            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AFter eighteen Months ſilence, Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> was pleaſed to publiſh an Anſwer to a Treatiſe of a ſheet and a half, penned by me with this Title, <hi>Dr. Stillingfleet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Dr. Stillingfleet:</hi> wherein I laid open the palpable Contradictions committed by him, in charging the <hi>Roman</hi> Church with Idolatry, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Salvation in her Communion, Fanaticiſme, and Diviſions in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith; endeavouring by this way to compel him <hi>to be his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Hence the Dr. took a fancy to frame of me the following Character.<note place="margin">Pref. Gen. <hi>pag. 3.</hi>

               <hi>That he is yet to learn the
<pb facs="tcp:102636:4"/>Art, and Terms of Railing.</hi> What? yet to learn the art and terms too, of Railing? well then, we may conclude, that he will never learn this art; for I am confident, there cannot be found in the world a man, who is able to teach him. <hi>A Juggler, a man without ſenſe, an empty veſſel, a Leviathan, a Puſionello, baſe ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, ſly inſinuations, abſurd, ſilly, and idle ſtuff, vain and ſophiſtical talk,</hi> and ſuch like, are (it ſeems) in this Drs. Dialect, terms only of pure civility. 'Tis in vain to examin, what Reaſon Dr. <hi>St.</hi> had to faſten upon my Companions, and my ſelf, ſuch ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous expreſſions. For we muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from him any Reaſon, or Proof, for what he ſaies.</p>
            <p>By theſe, and ſuch like Romantick Phraſes, which are the chief Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, that ſets off his works, we may eaſily gueſs, in what books this Dr. of Divinity has ſpent his
<pb facs="tcp:102636:5"/>time, and that he is well verſt in <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> the <hi>Seven Champions,</hi> and other <hi>Romantick</hi> Stories. Sure he erred in his Vocation; had he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all ſerious matters, and dedicated himſelf wholly to Drollery, and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, with two or three years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Hudibras,</hi> he would have been a Maſter in that Faculty: the Stage might have been a gainer by it, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> would have been no loſer.</p>
            <p>But who would imagin, that in the very ſame book, and within ſome few leaves, where he Characterizes his Adverſaries in ſuch reproachful lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, he ſhould have the confidence to affirm,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pref.</hi> p. 5.</note> 
               <hi>I have learn'd of him,</hi> who when he was reviled, reviled not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>not only to forbear reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them</hi> [his Adverſaries] <hi>in the ſame manner,</hi> (is it, becauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches them in a far higher man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?) <hi>but to return them good for evil, and to pray for them, while
<pb facs="tcp:102636:5"/>they calumniate me.</hi> What language is reproachful, if the forementioned expreſſions be not? If ſuch be Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s Prayers, who will be ſo mad, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Dr. to pray for him? or what Contradiction can there be more pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, than to revile us in ſuch a manner, and then to tell us, that he does not revile us, but only pray for us? Suppoſe, that one of as hot a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſhould call him <hi>a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Sophiſter, an empty Veſſel, a Juggler, a man without ſenſe, a half-witted man, a Romantick Knight, a Socinian Leviathan, a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionello, the 8th Champion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, and a leader into Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme;</hi> (for ſuch fine Epithets as theſe he is pleaſed to beſtow, either upon all Catholicks in general, or upon ſome in particular:) ſhould one (I ſay) draw ſuch a Character of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and then tell him, <q rend="margQuotes">Sir, after all this, I have no intention to revile you: God forbid I ſhould. I do
<pb facs="tcp:102636:6"/>only pray for you.</q> What opinion could any rational man conceive of ſuch a perſon, who ſhould ſo palpably, and ſo notoriouſly contradict himſelf? But alas! poor Dr. I pity him; he is ſo poſſeſt with the Spirit of Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that he can ſcarce write ſome few leaves without falling into one of his Fits: and even in this book, where he had made it his buſineſs to clear himſelf from ſo foul an imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he could not forbear to afford us freſh proofs, and inſtances thereof.</p>
            <p>Neither am I ignorant, at what Dr. <hi>St.</hi> aims with this manner of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He would fain have me conteſt with him, either at Drolling, or Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and then he would be ſure to have the better of me; and between Railing and Drolling we ſhould both make a fine buſineſs of Religion; but I am far from any ſuch intent: I know him too well. He is as pitiful at Arguing, as excellent at Drolling;
<pb facs="tcp:102636:6"/>and I am reſolved to attack him on the weakeſt ſide, let him complain never ſo much.</p>
            <p>Nor could the Dr. have given the world a more pregnant Teſtimony, that his Adverſaries have pinched, and galled him, than by uſing ſuch unhandſome, and paſſionate expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt them. For, all wiſe men do clearly underſtand, that whoever, in ſerious debates, (ſuch as thoſe of Religion are, with all perſons, who have any ſenſe of Religion in them) when he is cloſely preſs'd; in lieu of Anſwering, falls a Railing, or a Drol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, he yields himſelf for defeated: not to ſeem ſo to ignorant people, (who think, that ſo long as the party ſpeaks, he anſwers) he will needs ſay ſomething, though it be nothing to the purpoſe. The beſt way to deal with ſuch Adverſaries, is to preſs the Arguments which nettled them. The Spur, Which touching only does make
<pb facs="tcp:102636:7"/>one kick, and wince; if often apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may tame and calm him.</p>
            <p>And though one ſhould be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, now and then, to ſprinkle even ſerious Diſcourſes with ſome ſort of Railery; yet what prudence could it be in Dr. <hi>St.</hi> when he had no leſs than Nine ſeveral Treatiſes to anſwer, (beſides others publiſhed before) iſſued forth againſt his Diſcourſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Idolatry of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or ſome part thereof; and ſuch as even Proteſtants were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he would have enough to do to anſwer them: what prudence could it be (I ſay) for him, in this Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, to miſ-ſpend ſo much time in framing Romantick Characters of his Adverſaries? Sure, had he been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that he could ſolidly anſwer them, he would preſently have cloſed with them, and diſpatch'd them; and not have ſtood off ſo long in Buffoone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And the effect he has obtained by
<pb facs="tcp:102636:7"/>this manner of anſwering ſeems to be, that having quite ſpent himſelf in theſe Drolling, and Railing Fits, he has been forced to be beholding to a Perſon of Honour, (though unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Polemical Conteſts, as his Book ſufficiently proclaims it) for anſwering his grave Adveerſary, <hi>S. C.</hi> and to <hi>Dr. Whitby,</hi> (though as that witty Author, <hi>J. V. C.</hi> tells us, <hi>he vents Reaſons,</hi>

               <hi>that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Man, that Prodigie of Ingenuity, and Learning,</hi> had he not Courage enough to Combate the Knight, even when his own party was in ſo great expectation of the Engagement? Muſt he be forced to
<pb facs="tcp:102636:8"/>ſubſtitute <hi>Whitby</hi> in his place? But to ſuch ſhifts as theſe one will be put, who, when he hath ſerious buſineſs in hand, trifles out his time in fopperies. Yea, probably ſpeaking, he will hire ſome ſuch man (and there are many ſuch men) as <hi>Dr. Whitby,</hi> to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the Squire too, for ſo he terms that Ingenious Writer, <hi>J. S.</hi> and the reſt of his Learned Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who remain unanſwered. Yet it is great pity, he ſhould not anſwer them all himſelf. For if any of their Books have not hitherto arrived to the eſteem they deſerve, let the <hi>Dr.</hi> anſwer them in particular, and they will not fail to gain the Repute due unto them. For my own part I can aſſure him, that not only I my ſelf, but ſeveral others too, have a greater eſteem for my little Book, ſince the <hi>Dr.</hi> was pleaſed to anſwer it, than we had before: and I am ſo far from fearing his Replies, that I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
<pb facs="tcp:102636:8"/>deſire he would Anſwer what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hereafter I ſhall Publiſh, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Controverſie.</p>
            <p>The ſubſtance of the Reply was finiſhed ſome few months after Dr. <hi>St. Examination</hi> of my Book came forth: the reaſon why it was not publiſhed ſooner, is, becauſe I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Dr. ſhould afford a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar anſwer to ſeveral Treatiſes, iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued forth againſt his diſcourſe of the <hi>Roman Idolatry</hi> (the book I atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued) which remained yet unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; to the end that having ſeen what he could anſwer to the whole charge layed to him in this debate, I might the better order my Reply. But ſince the Dr. in ſo long a time has not yet been pleaſed to ſatisfie ſo juſt an expectation, for ſome good reaſons he knows; I reſolved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any farther delay, to ſet forth this Rejoynder; eſpecially being preſt thereunto by the invitation of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> On ſuppoſition Dr. <hi>St.</hi> contradicts himſelf in the way I inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the Charges he caſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Roman Church are falſe, and all their proofs void.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter Dr. <hi>St.</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed two Prefaces to his Book, the one of 82 pages, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of 12: he ſets upon the examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Treatiſe; which with Introduction, Anſwer, and Appendix, contains only 21 pages, though in a cloſer letter. He deſignes to prove two things againſt me. 1. That on ſuppoſition he did contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the way I inſiſt upon, yet that would be no ſufficient Anſwer to his Book, <hi>Page</hi> 14. 2. That he is far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from contradicting himſelf in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102636:11"/>any one of the things I charge him with.</p>
               <p>In reply to theſe two Points, I ſhall ſhew, 1. What follows if the Dr. Contradicts himſelf: and hence will appear, whether on ſuppoſition he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicts himſef in the way I inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I anſwer his Book, or not. 2. That he palpably contradicts himſelf in the forementioned Charges, he lays upon the Roman Church. And that the Dr. may ſee I have a mind to deal fairly with him, I am very willing to be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Learned men of our Two Famous Univerſities (where there are many as ingenious as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and far more ingenuous) not only whether I have not proved that the Dr. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts himſelf; but alſo whether, this being once proved in the way I inſiſt upon, I do not invalidate and annual all the above-mentioned Charges he lays againſt the Roman Church, with all the Reaſons, and Proofs he produces, or can produce to make them good.</p>
               <p>To commence therefore the firſt Point of this Reply, If I have proved that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has contradicted himſelf in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102636:11"/>the aforeſaid Crimes he imputes to the Roman Church (which is the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition wherein he, and we ſpeak in this firſt part) it manifeſtly follows, that I have obtained the deſign of my Book, couched in the Title thereof, <hi>viz</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> againſt Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet:</hi> and if I moreover ſhew, that he ſtill contradicts himſelf, I compleat alſo the Subject and Title of this Rejoynder, Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet ſtill againſt Dr. Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet.</hi> For nothing elſe is aimed at in theſe Titles, but only to evince, that the Dr. did contradict, and perſiſts to contradict himſelf. This is apparent from what I inſinuated at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of my Book, in theſe words, <hi>page</hi> 1. <hi>My aim therefore in this ſhort Paper, only is, to lay open the palpable contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Dr.</hi> St. <hi>in imputing to the Roman Church the forementioned Calumnies.</hi> And what more can be expected from a Writer, than to fill up the Subject and Deſigne of his Diſcourſe? Eſpecially, if the Deſigne be of great Conſequence, as this is, according to what now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>Again, Self-contradiction being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102636:12"/>as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himſelf grants, <hi>p.</hi> 15. over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the authority of the Perſon, who ſtands convicted thereof, Now I conceive, that a ſheet and half of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was not ill-imployed in overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (had it no other effect) the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of one, who pretends to be a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of the Proteſtant Church, and who gains more upon his Devotees by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than by reaſon. So that, even according to Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s confeſſion, ſelf-contradiction being once evidenced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; we ought not to believe him in any thing he ſays, or alledges unleſs he recalls himſelf. For, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve one is to take a thing upon his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: and ſure no body ought to take any thing upon the authority and credit of one, who has loſt all authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and credit.</p>
               <p>Beſides, whoever forces his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to grant manifeſt Contradictions, or ſhews that he grants them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rigour of Logique, and cloſe arguing, he puts him in a ſack, he brings him to a <hi>Non-plus,</hi> and in plain vulgar Engliſh, he makes an Aſs of him, or ſhews him to be ſo, unleſs he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102636:12"/>recants. And can more than this be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of one to confute and confound his Adverſary? or can one preſs him further than to a <hi>Non-plus?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, Whoever grants and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts to grant palpable Contradictions, he may juſtly be poſted up for a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Should one (for inſtance) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Plague ſay, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat that he is in very good health, but withal, that he is deadly ſick of the Plague; could there be a clearer Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome, that ſuch a man's brains were diſtemper'd, than to hear him harp upon ſo palpable a contradiction? And there is no wiſe man who will have to do with Mad-men, no, not <hi>in their Lucid Intervals,</hi> as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> in his <hi>Pref. p.</hi> 11. gravely obſerves. For though Mad-men &amp; Fools may ſometimes ſay ſhrew'd things, yet no body who is perſwaded they are ſuch, can in prudence think himſelf bound to confute them, but rather to pity them; nor to ſolve their Objections, but to ſlight them: though it does not follow, becauſe they are ſo, that all their Arguments are falſe, and their Objections null. This
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102636:13"/>I have ſaid, becauſe I perceive there are ſeveral, who are not ſenſible what groſs abſurdities do follow from ſelf-contradiction.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs the Dr. ſtill urges, <hi>That all this is no ſufficient anſwer to his Book.</hi> For though he confeſſes, that ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicition, being once evidenced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, all his authority and credit is worth nothing, and conſequently he is not to be believed or credited in any thing he quotes or alledges, and all his Arguments which depend upon the truth of his Quotations, are not to be valued; nay, neither is one bound to make enquiry, whether his Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be true or not. For who is bound to make inquiry into the truth of what a Mad-man, or one that hath forfeited all his credit does ſay or alledge? Yet after all this he affirms, and vapours in almoſt every leaf of this firſt part, that his Arguments, eſpecially ſuch as do not depend upon the truth of his Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations (and how few has he of ſuch Arguments?) remain firm, ſolid, and unanſwered? Now to diſabuſe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and his Partizans in this Point;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102636:13"/>I ſhall demonſtrate that in the preſent Suppoſition, <hi>viz. That he contradicts himſelf in the way I inſiſt upon, by laying to our charge the above mentioned crimes:</hi> not only all the aforeſaid Aſperſions, but alſo all the Arguments which he produces, or can produce either from Authority or Reaſon, in proof of them, are void and of no force. And to this purpoſe I ſet down theſe following Principles; which, though appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to Logique, this Dr. of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſeems to be ignorant of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>When two Propoſitions contradict one another, both cannot be true; but either the one or the other muſt needs be falſe.</hi> This is a manifeſt Principle of Natural Logique; wherefore if theſe two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, <hi>The Roman Church is a true Church; the Roman Church is an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Church,</hi> do contradict one another (as now we ſuppoſe they do) it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently follows, that both of them are not true; but that either the one or the other is falſe. The ſame may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the other Contradictions, wherewith I charge the Doctor in the progreſs of my diſcourſe.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:102636:14"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>When of two Propoſitions that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictone another, the one is true and taken for granted; the other is neceſſarily falſe.</hi> This is alſo certain; otherwiſe both of them would be true; which is impoſſible according to the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. If therefore the firſt of the two Propoſitions quoted above, <hi>viz. The Roman Church is a true Church,</hi> be true, and taken for granted, it manifeſtly follows, that the ſecond Propoſition, <hi>viz. The Roman Church is an Idolatrous Church,</hi> is falſe; ſuppoſing as we do ſuppoſe, that they contradict one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The like alſo may be affirmed of the other contradictory Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which we have laid to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors charge.</p>
               <p>Now the way I inſiſted upon all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in my diſcourſe is comprehended in theſe 4. Points ſet down in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof, in theſe words. 1. <hi>I ſhall in brief propoſe the Accuſation he frames a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Church.</hi> 2. <hi>I ſhall lay down ſome few Principles, either manifeſt in themſelves or at leaſt owned by Dr.</hi> St. <hi>and his Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans.</hi> 3. <hi>From theſe Principles I ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> one or two Syllogiſms deduce the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102636:14"/>of the Accuſation framed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.</hi> 4. <hi>I ſhall cloſe up each Point with facing together the manifeſt Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions committed by</hi> Dr. St. <hi>in reference to the preſent Aſperſion.</hi> Whence clearly appears, that though I aim in the laſt place, only at the Contradictions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Doctor (and entitled thence my Book) yet I intended by the way to annul (as I have annulled) out of true and ſolid Principles, owned by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and his Aſſociates, all the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations he laid againſt us. For, what more can be required to annul them, than to prove their condictories to be true? And hence appears how frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly the Dr. ſuppoſes (as in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he ſeems to do) that I have done nothing elſe in my whole Book, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet down the Contradictions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by him: whereas of four Points, whereinto I divided each diſcourſe, one only is employ'd upon this Subject.</p>
               <p>According to this my deſigne, inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated in the forementioned words; in each Point I took two Propoſitions, the one contained the Charge laid upon us by the Doctor; the other (which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102636:15"/>I proved to be oppoſite to the former, and is admitted as ſuch by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> in this firſt part) was granted by him, as in the reſpective places I demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Neither do I ſee, that the Dr. as yet has denied any of ſuch Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as far as they concern my intent: yea, we ſuppoſe now by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that he grants all ſuch Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for how can he contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in two Propoſitions (which is the Hypotheſis we proceed upon at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) unleſs he grants them both? Hence I inferred that the charges he laid againſt us were falſe, and of no force.</p>
               <p>The Subſtance of our Diſcourſe in brief is this. If the Propoſitions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by us above, do contradict one another; and ſuch of them be true, and taken for granted, as are oppoſite to the Charges laid againſt us, ſuch Charges muſt neceſſarily be falſe. But the fore-mentioned Propoſitions do contradict one another, as we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the Dr. now admits; and ſuch of them as are oppoſite to the Charges laid againſt us are true, and taken for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102636:15"/>granted; (for this is the way I inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, and it is ſuppoſed here, that the Dr. grants them.) Therefore on Suppoſition that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> contradicts himſelf in the way I inſiſted upon, the Charges he lays againſt us muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be falſe. And this is the common way Authors inſiſt upon when they ſee, that their Adverſary grants ſomething true in it ſelf, and oppoſite to the Concluſion he has undertaken to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend; they take for granted the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Propoſition as favourable unto them, and wherein they agree with their Adverſary, and infer thence the falſity of the later, wherein they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from him. But to ſhew alſo that I deſtroy all the Doctors Reaſons too, wherewith he pretends to make good the aforeſaid Charges, I add this third Principle.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Whatever is brought, or can be brought in proof of a falſity; is either falſe, or inconcluſive.</hi> This is alſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. For there can be no true, real, and ſolid proof of a falſity; according to that Maxime, <hi>Ex vero tantum non ſequitur falſum.</hi> Out of Truth alone
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102636:16"/>no falſity can be legally inferred. For if the Concluſion be falſe, either all the Premiſſes are not true; or if they be ſo, they do not infer the Concluſion: whence I argue thus:</p>
               <p>If the formentioned Charges which the Doctor imputes to the Roman Church be falſe, whatſoever he brings, or can bring in proof of them, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther falſe, or inconcluſive.</p>
               <p>But on ſuppoſition the Dr. contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himſelf in the way I inſiſt upon, all ſuch Charges are falſe, as has been proved.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the ſame ſuppoſition, whatſoever he brings, or can bring in proof of them, is either falſe or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive</p>
               <p>Whence appears how illogically Dr. <hi>St.</hi> urges, that though he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelf in the Aſperſions he caſts upon us, and in the way I inſiſt upon, yet the Reaſons he produces to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſuch Aſperſions are good and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid. Wherefore I never affirmed, that meerly becauſe he contradicted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, all his Arguments on both ſides of the contradiction were null. For one
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102636:16"/>part of the contradiction may be true, and the Arguments to prove it good and ſolid. True it is, that when one contradicts himſelf, his proofs on both ſides cannot be good; ſince one part of the contradiction muſt needs be falſe; and there can be no good proof of a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. What therefore I intended to ſhew, was, That the Dr. by contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting common Principles owned by himſelf in the Charges he lays up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us [ſee the Introduction to my Book] ſuch Charges were falſe, and conſequently their proofs void.</p>
               <p>Neither do I ever aver, that what he alledges in proof of the aforeſaid Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, is determinately falſe, but disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, that it is either falſe or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive. And now let any rational man judge, whether this be not a ſufficient anſwer to his Book, <hi>viz.</hi> not only to annul all the Charges he lays upon us, but all the Reaſons too, and Arguments wherewith he pretends to make ſuch Charges good, by demonſtrating that on ſuppoſition he contradicts himſelf in the way I inſiſt upon, all the above-mentioned Charges are void, and their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102636:17"/>Reaſons either falſe, or inconcluſive.</p>
               <p>But the Doctor preſſes that I do not anſwer his Reaſons in particular; what then? if I cut them off all at once, what matter is it that I do not cut them off one by one? To deſtroy a houſe, 'tis of little concern whether we pull it down Tile by Tile, Brick by Brick, and Stone by Stone, till we have laid it in the duſt, or whether undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Foundations, we blow it up in a moment. Both ways are effectual to deſtroy a houſe: the difference is, that the firſt is tedious, the ſecond is quick and active. And as it would be very ridiculous for one to ſay, when his houſe was blown up, and ſhivered into pieces, that notwithſtanding it was not ſufficiently deſtroyed, becauſe (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) it was not pulled down metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically ſtone after ſtone, and brick after brick; ſo it is extreme abſurd for Dr. <hi>St.</hi> to vapour, that though all the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations he frames againſt us are proved null, and all the Arguments he brings to make them out, are ſhewn to be falſe, yet his Book is not ſufficiently anſwered, becauſe all his Arguments
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102636:17"/>are not ſolved one by one, nor metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically anſwered.</p>
               <p>Hence appears, that one may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured (contrary to what Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſeems to imagine <hi>p.</hi> 29.) concerning the Truth &amp; ſafety of the Roman-Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, though he hears it charged with Idolatry by Arguments pretended to be drawn from ſeveral Topicks, whereof the Dr. makes uſe, without examining each Argument in particular. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Dr. will not oblige all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, if they deſire to remain ſatisfied concerning the truth and purity of Chriſtian Religion, to examine in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular whatever <hi>Lucian, Porphyrius,</hi> and others of their Gang, have objected againſt it; though they pretended alſo to draw their Argments from the ſame, or the like Topicks, and had as good an Opinion, and with as much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon too, of what they objected againſt Chriſtianity, as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has of what he produces in oppoſition to the particular Tenets of Catholick Religion.</p>
               <p>Is it not enough to the end one may remain ſatisfied concerning the Truth and ſafety of his Religion, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102636:18"/>the Objections made againſt it, that he be convinced, that all ſuch Objections are falſe, and all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alledged in proof of them invalid and of no force? Now to know that ſuch Objections are falſe, 'tis enough to be perſwaded that they contradict ſome common and true Principle aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto both by the perſon who is to remain ſatisfied, and ſuch as make the Objections. For, what ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the Truth, is falſe: and if the Objections be falſe, 'tis evident that all their proofs are falſe or impertinent: and this is the method we obſerved throughout our whole Treatiſe, as is manifeſt.</p>
               <p>The Dr. in his particular Preface de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcants at large againſt the manner wherewith his Adverſaries anſwer this Book of his. <hi>One man</hi> (ſays he) <hi>picks out a Sentence here and there to anſwer; another, a page or two together: a third leaps from one thing to another, as if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to paſs by the greateſt difficulties: But he is a man of courage indeed, that dares fall upon the rear, and begin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute a Book at the end of it: So that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102636:18"/>if he lives long enough, and get heart he may in time come to the beginning.</hi> Sure Dr. <hi>St.</hi> did expect we ſhould adviſe with him, which way we are to attack him. Let him evince, that we do not deſtroy the Aſperſions he caſts upon us, and their proofs, and he will do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But when we have beaten down all his Aſſertions againſt us, and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments too, to cry out, that we have not ſtruck him in the right place, is very ridiculous.</p>
               <p>This puts me in minde of what I have heard concerning a dapper young man, well ſet, yet of a low ſtature; who truſting to a grant Buckler, wherewith he ſheltred himſelf, would encounter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one. Among ſeveral that worſted him, he met with one taler than himſelf, who over-reaching his Buckler, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him two or three ſhrewd blows o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the head, ſtruck him to the ground together with his Buckler. Then the poor man, after he had ſprawled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, having recovered himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to enveigh againſt his Adverſary, ſaying, <hi>A Pox take ye, could you not ſee my Buckler?</hi> There is no need for me
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102636:19"/>to make the Application. As it would therefore be of little comfort for us, if we have not deſtroyed his Book, that we attacked him the right way: So in all reaſon it ought to be of little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for the Dr. if we have deſtroyed his Book, that we did not ſet upon him that way, which he imagined to be the only right and methodical way to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn him. Certainly Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py man, if he can ſolace himſelf with ſuch pitiful excuſes as theſe.</p>
               <p>In particular he complains of <hi>N. O.</hi> and <hi>J. S.</hi> becauſe, as he ſays, <hi>Gen. Pref. pag.</hi> 4.40. <hi>They ſteal quite behind his Book, and ſhew a particular spite at the Dragons Tail.</hi> The reaſon why he ſays thus is, becauſe they confute the later end of his Book. But if they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul the part they ſet upon, what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters all this? what General, who had his Army routed by the Enemy, did ever think it a ſufficient excuſe, to ſay, <hi>That they fell upon the rear, and ſo routed him?</hi> And though I do not affirm, that Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s Book hath neither head nor tail, yet I may with truth aver, that his Book reſembles a Monſter in this, that it has
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102636:19"/>the head, where it ſhould have the tail; for he ends with the Principles of his Religion: whereas, according to the natural method of writing, he ſhould have begun not ended with them. Since therefore the Dr. ends where he ſhould begin, what wonder is it, that theſe two worthy Authors ſhould begin, where he ends!</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Several Objections againſt the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned way of anſwering the <hi>Dr.</hi> proved inſignificant.</head>
               <p>THis way of anſwering is <hi>new,</hi> as the Dr. will needs have it. Is not this to trifle out the time, and plainly to acknowledge that he is deſtitute of a ſolid reply? If the way I have taken be a <hi>true</hi> and an <hi>effectual</hi> way to confute his Book (as we have ſhewen it is) of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102636:20"/>what damage is it, that it be a <hi>new</hi> way? Moreover, this manner of confuting I have inſiſted upon, cannot ſeem <hi>new</hi> to any one, who is acquainted with the Schools. For though the Defendant may produce ſeveral Reaſons to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Concluſion he undertakes to maintain; yet the Opponent common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſets upon the Concluſion, without taking notice of the Reaſons; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when he is perſwaded that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is falſe: and if he deſtroys the Concluſion, all the Reaſons produced in defence thereof, fall to the ground. And certainly a Defendant would be laught at, who after he had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by his Adverſaries, and had his Concluſion annulled, ſhould cry out, <hi>Though the Concluſion be falſe, yet the Reaſons are good and ſolid:</hi> or ſhould not be able to afford any other anſwer, than that <hi>the Argument made againſt him was</hi> new, <hi>and never before heard of by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, ſhould one deſtroy all the Arguments one by one, wherewith his Adverſary pretends to make good the <hi>Theſis</hi> he defends; yet in rigour he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102636:20"/>would not therefore (unleſs he adds ſome other principle) deſtroy the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis;</hi> but only ſhew, that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant does not prove it well. But if one deſtroys the <hi>Theſis</hi> (which is a more compendious way) it is evident, that he annuls all the Reaſons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments brought in proof thereof. Yea, if this way of not anſwering each Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in particular, be New, I was not the Inventer of it. For Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himſelf, in his Diſcourſe of Idolatry, (which was publiſhed before my Book ſaw Light) <hi>p.</hi> 558. affirms, <hi>That the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Proteſtant Religion,</hi> which he ſets down at the end of that work, <hi>are a ſufficient Anſwer to Proteſtancy without Principles;</hi> whereas it is manifeſt, that in his whole Appendix of Principles he does neither State the Controverſie plainly, nor examin the proofs that Learned Author produces, nor apply diſtinct Anſwers to his Arguments, fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented in their own words: which is what he ſayes Proteſtant Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters obſerve, <hi>Pref. pag.</hi> 3. when they ſet themſelves to Anſwer our Books: And I appeal to the Judgment of any
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102636:21"/>Impartial perſon, who has taken the pains to peruſe his late Anſwers to the formentioned book, <hi>Proteſtancy without Prnciples, to Reaſon and Religion, and to the Guide in Controverſie,</hi> whether he has performed all the aforeſaid For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, which he requires of us, <hi>ibid. pag.</hi> 4. and whether he does not pick up here and there ſome Sentences to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, or one Chapter or two together, or leaps from one thing to another, as if reſolved to paſs by the greateſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; or omits whole Diſcourſes, as the fourth and fifth Diſcourſe in the <hi>Guide in Controverſie: All theſe little Arts and Shifts</hi> in us (ſais the Dr.) are <hi>either plain Acknowledgments of a baffled Cauſe,</hi> or <hi>an Argument of a weak and unskilful Management.</hi> Whereas all theſe very ſame Arts in the Dr. muſt be preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant proofs of a good Cauſe, and of a skilful management thereof.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, That Dr. <hi>St.</hi> may be permitted to anſwer as he pleaſe, and without tying himſelf to the abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Formalities; becauſe he has lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a ſecret proper to himſelf, <hi>to draw off all the ſpirit of a book in two or three
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102636:21"/>lines,</hi> (Pref. Gen. pag. 30.) and all the reſt he leaves behind, (<hi>viz.</hi> all that he cannot Anſwer, which is the far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of his Adverſaries Books) is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Phlegm,</hi> and <hi>Caput mortuum.</hi> But we, poor Souls, to whom Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has not as yet had the Charity to impart this Secret, unleſs we anſwer his book Chapter by Chapter, Paragraph by Paragraph, and Point by Point, we do nothing. Whoever deſires to ſee more concerning Dr. <hi>St.</hi> 's manner of writing, let him read the Firſt Letter, written by the Worthy Author of <hi>Some General Obſervations upon Dr.</hi> St. <hi>'s Book, and way of Writing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the true reaſon why Dr. <hi>St.</hi> frets ſo much at my manner of dealing with him, ſeems to be, becauſe he thought it a diſparagement, that ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a Book ſhould be publiſhed againſt ſo great a Dr. and that I ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel him, in no more than a ſheet and a half, to fall foul on himſelf, and to be his own Executioner. The Dr. ſeems to be in the vulgar Errour of ſuch, as mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Books by their Bulks, and Imagin, that in a little book, ſuch as he ſtiles
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102636:22"/>
                  <hi>Rats</hi> and <hi>Flies,</hi> there can be no great thing. But he muſt know, that a Rat can overcome an Elephant, and that Flies have been able to rout vaſt Armies.</p>
               <p>Hence any one may ſee, what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives I had, to take this way of Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dr. <hi>St.</hi> whereof he will needs make ſo great a Miſtery. My intention was to diſpatch him in ſhort, and to ſet forth a little Book againſt him: which I could never have performed, ſhould I have anſwered all his Arguments one by one, and obſerved all the other Formalities, he will needs oblige us to. Beſides, the Conveniencies of a little book are very great. It is eaſily made, eaſily Printed, eaſily bought, and eaſily read: and conſequently thereby are ſpared two precious things, Time and Money. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Thouſand Copies of Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet against Dr. Stillingfleet</hi> went off in three weeks or a month, and had I Printed as many more, I might have diſpatch'd them all: On the contrary, a great Volume cannot be made without great labour, nor Printed without great Expences: and when it is made and Printed, few buy it, and fewer have
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102636:22"/>time or patience to read it over. A Peſtilent Book may be daſh'd at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with a ſhort Paper, before it ſpreads its Venome: but this being once ſpread, a whole Volume will ſcarce ſuffice to quell it. A Pail of Water may quench a Fire, before it extends itſelf: whereas a far greater quantity will not be effectual to a vert its fury, if it once makes it ſelf maſter of a houſe.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, (as many do) that ſome deny the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be a true Church; which is to deſtroy, and pull down the very ſtreſs, whereon is builded our whole Diſcourſe. I ſay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that many deny the Antient Fathers; others, all General Councils; and others, the very Scripture it ſelf: nay what is there, that ſome do not deny? May we not therefore Argue well out of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Councils and Scriptures, againſt ſuch as admit theſe Topicks? Neither is it neceſſary to prove alwayes our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion out of General Principles, which all, or moſt, agree unto: otherwiſe we ſhould never argue in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of certain Books of Scripture, which Jews, and ſome Sectaries do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102636:23"/>againſt ſuch as do allow of thoſe Books. Particular Principles come neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the Concluſion we pretend to prove: &amp; conſequently, if they be true, &amp; aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, by both parties, they carry us a ſhorter way to the Truth we aim at.</p>
               <p>Moreover, though ſome deny the <hi>Roman Church to be a true Church,</hi> yet many grant it; and it is the Senſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, and the Perſwaſion of all Learned Proteſtants, as many of their own Profeſſion aver, according to what we have quoted in <hi>Dr. Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet againſt Dr. Stillingfleet,</hi> pag. 3, 4. Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himſelf aſſents unto it, Fanaticks approve of it, and <hi>Latitudinarians,</hi> who maintain all Religions to be true, ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defend it; and many times they ſeem angry with us, that we ſhould queſtion, whether they grant our Church to be a True Church. Of thoſe, who profeſs themſelves Chriſtians in <hi>England,</hi> only ſome rigid Presbyterians deny it: yea, the title of Reformers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which Moder Sectaries take upon them, does manifeſtly imply, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion &amp; the Reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as they ſtile it, is the ſame in ſubſtance,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102636:23"/>and different only in Accidentals: and conſequently if theirs be true, ours muſt alſo be true: for it is impoſſible, that a true Church, and not a true Church, ſhould be the ſame in Subſtance. To Reform a Church is not to deſtroy its Eſſence, but to redreſs its Diſorders. The Apoſtles were not ſent to Reform Paganiſm: and why? becauſe they Deſtroyed it; bringing in, in lieu there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, Chriſtian Religion, of a different Subſtance and Nature. The fire deſtroys wood, and Refines Gold; becauſe it changes the very Subſtance of Wood into Aſhes; but it only takes away the droſs of Gold, and leaves its Subſtance, and Eſſence untouched.</p>
               <p>Dealing therefote with the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Perſons, as in this Treatiſe I do, I might with much reaſon take that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition for granted; and ſhould I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter an Adverſary, who denies the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be a true Church, I would ſet upon him another way, and prove it to be a True Church: which is not hard to do. For different wayes are to be taken with different Adverſaries, and what is a ſolid proof againſt one, is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102636:24"/>of no force againſt another. I confeſs therefore, that all the Arguments I have framed againſt Dr. <hi>St.</hi> grounded upon this Principle, <hi>The Roman Church is a true Church</hi> are of no force, with ſuch as deny That Principle, unleſs firſt I prove it. In the ſame manner all the Arguments, grounded upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Fathers, and Councils, are of no force againſt Fanaticks, who ſlight the Fathers and Councils, unleſs their Authority be firſt eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>Hence appears, how inſignificantly Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and his <hi>Cabal,</hi> threaten us that if we preſs them out of this Principle, <hi>The Roman Church is a True Church,</hi> freely granted by them; they will deny it, and fall back from what they have yielded unto; and that we ſhall get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe thereby, but to make them leſs Charitable towards us, and the difference between us wider. For in the ſame manner they might threaten us, when we argue againſt them out of Councils and Fathers, admitted by them, that if we preſs them they will deny their Authority: Neither ſhould any one preſs another out of Scripture,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102636:24"/>though granted by him; for fear, leaſt if he be preſs'd, he will deny Scripture, and become a Turk, or a Pagan. Nay, ſince one cannot convince another, but out of what he has aſſented unto, were this way of dealing warrantable, any one might eaſily elude all Arguments whatſoever. For either we urge our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, or not: if not, how ſhall we convince him? if ſo, he may ſtave off the Conviction, according to Dr. <hi>St.</hi> 's manner of dealing, by threatning us, that if we urge him, we ſhall get only this of him, that he will deny what al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready he has granted, Doubtleſs the Scholars of the Illuſtrious Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> would be aſhamed of their Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſhould they hear him ſay, in a publick Diſpute to his Adverſary, <hi>Do not preſs me; for if you do, I'le deny what I have already granted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, ſince this Aſſertion, <hi>The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church is a True Church,</hi> is common, aſſented unto, not only by Catholicks, but alſo by Proteſtants of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, and others of different Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as we have ſeen: But this other, <hi>The Roman Church is Idolatrous,</hi> is deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102636:25"/>both by Catholicks, and ſeveral lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and zealous Proteſtants: and ſince either the one, or the other of theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions is to be recalled, ſuppoſing they contradict one another, 'tis more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to recal the latter, than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, becauſe <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> particular Sentiments are to yield to common Principles, when they run Counter.</p>
               <p>But what is the reaſon, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> who profeſſes himſelf a mortal enemy to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, does not deny it to be a true Church, recalling what heretofore he has aſſerted? yea, he is ſo far from recalling it, that he rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, and grants ſeveral times, in this Examination of my book, in plain terms, what he had affirmed in his <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Account,</hi> that the <hi>Roman Church is a True Church.</hi> I inſinuated in my Book, in the place above quoted, ſeveral mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, why Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and his Aſſociates, do unanimoſly aver the <hi>Roman Church</hi> to be <hi>a True Church:</hi> Becauſe upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they ground the pretended Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Charity of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churh, wherewith they endeavour to inveigle unwary minds: and if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102636:25"/>the Roman Church to be a true Church, either they muſt confeſs that there was no true viſible Church in the world for many hundred of years be-<hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvins</hi> time, or they are ſhrewdly put to it when we urge them to ſhew us which that true viſible Church was, diſtinct from the Roman.</p>
               <p>Yet another particular reaſon moved Dr. <hi>St.</hi> not to recal what he had aſſerted concerning the Truth of the Roman Church. For he could not but ſee that ſhould he deny the Roman Church to be a true Church, he muſt either deny the Proteſtant Church to be a true Church, or ſeek out other grounds to prove the truth thereof different from thoſe he laid down in his Rational Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. For the Diſcourſe he makes in that Book to eſtabliſh the truth of the Proteſtant Religion in ſubſtance is this: <hi>Whatever Church holds all ſuch points as were held by all Chriſtian Societies of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, &amp; acknowledged by</hi> Rome <hi>it ſelf; has all that is neceſſary to the being of a true Church, and by Conſequence is a True Church. But ſuch is the Proteſtant Church, as he affirms: Therefore accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102636:26"/>to his Principles it is a true Church.</hi> And deſcending to particulars, he ſays, <hi>That all Churches, which admit the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Creeds</hi> (as the Roman Church e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently does) are true Churches.</p>
               <p>Now theſe Principles whereon the Dr. bottoms the truth of Proteſtancie, do neceſſarily imply that the Roman Church is a true Church. For, either the Roman Church acknowledges what is ſufficient to conſtitute the being of a true Church or not; if ſhe does, ſhe muſt neceſſarily be a true Church. If ſhe does not, how can Dr. <hi>St.</hi> aſſert, <hi>That the Roman Church, with other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Societies acknowledges what is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to conſtitute the being of a true Church?</hi> Wherefore, unleſs Dr. <hi>St.</hi> grants the Roman Church to be a true Church, that Principle whereon he grounds the truth of Proteſtancie, <hi>viz.</hi> That it admits whatſoever is admitted by all Chriſtian Societies, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, is of no force. So that unleſs Dr. <hi>St.</hi> maintains the truth of the Roman Church, he muſt either confeſs that Proteſtancie is no true Religion, and that the Account he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102636:26"/>has hitherto given concerning the grounds of Proteſtancy, is void and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational; or ſeek out other Principles to prove it. Now if Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has ſuch a pike againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that to the end he may prove her Idolatrous, or no true Church; he cares not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church Proteſtancy, or at leaſt to cancel whatever he has yet ſaid to ſhew, that it is a True Religion; I conceive that Proteſtants will give him little thanks for his pains. But the truth is, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> if we reflect well upon his works, cares not what becomes of Proteſtancy, nor Chriſtianity neither; ſo that he may, according to his fancy, deſtroy Popery. But we care as little for his attempts, if he cannot deſtroy Popery, without undermining Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>The Dr. ſeems, in ſeveral places of his Anſwer, ſlily to inſinuate, as if he had only been heretofore of opinion, that the <hi>Roman Church is a true Church;</hi> but that now he has altered his Opinion: and it can be no diſparagement for a man to recal what heretofore he aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To this purpoſe he alledges, <hi>pag.</hi> 16. the <hi>Recognitions of Bellarmin,</hi> who, in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102636:27"/>imitation of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> retracted ſome former Errours delivered by him. But where, I pray, has D. <hi>St.</hi> made any book of Recognitions, recalling his former Errours? though he might make a juſt Volume upon that Subject, and begin it with the Recantation of what he ſets down in his <hi>Irenicon,</hi> deſtructive to the Epiſcopal Dignity; which he is loth to do; for he ſees, that book en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared him to the Presbyterian party; whom he ſeems to Court. I confeſs, that it is no blemiſh for a man, when he is better informed, to recal the Errours which heretofore he aſſented unto. For, to err, is a frailty of men; but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere obſtinately in an Errour, (as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily he muſt do, who perſiſts in a palpable Contradiction) is a brutiſh ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy: and what greater diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than this can there be for a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal man!</p>
               <p>Now Dr. <hi>St.</hi> not only heretofore, but even in this preſent book, after he had Charged the <hi>Roman</hi> Church with <hi>groſs Idolatry,</hi> affirms, that ſhe is a <hi>true Church,</hi> (as ſhall hereafter appear) without having ever yet recalled that Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102636:27"/>and conſequently he perſiſts to contradict himſelf, as he now admits.</p>
               <p>Whence follows, that the Allegation of <hi>Bellarmin's Recognitions,</hi> or <hi>Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> was nothing to the purpoſe. For it is as if one ſhould argue thus; <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> though he erred, yet becauſe he recalled his Errours, making a Book of <hi>Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> did not loſe his Reputation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he deſerve, that we ſhould ſlight what he ſaies: Therefore Dr. <hi>St.</hi> who has erred, and does perſiſt to err, who has, and does ſtill contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without ever having recalled his Errours, does not deſerve we ſhould ſlight what he affirms: or thus: Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> though he ſinned grievouſly, yet becauſe he did ſincerely repent, was a great Saint: Therefore ſuch as have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned grievouſly, and never repent, are great Saints. Let Dr. <hi>St.</hi> imitate <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin,</hi> and recal his former Errous, and he will loſe nothing, no, not his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: which notwithſtanding, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf affirms, Self-contradiction being once proved, eſpecially if it be inſiſted upon, is utterly overthrown.</p>
               <p>But we muſt reflect, That ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102636:28"/>their former Opinions, or Tenets, are in two ſorts. Some recal Tenets heretofore aſſented unto, becauſe they find them inconſiſtent with Errours, which they are reſolved to defend; as if one (for inſtance) who being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to vindicate <hi>the General Principles of Christianity,</hi> without confeſſing the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Tenets of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be true, ſhould out of hatred to ſuch particular Tenets, deny the <hi>General principles of Chriſtianity;</hi> which before he had yielded unto. Such men as theſe, are far from deſerving any Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for recalling their former perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; but rather ſhew an inveterate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, and odium againſt the Truth: and amongſt ſuch men, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> muſt be enrolled, ſhould he, to defend the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, deny her to be a <hi>true Church,</hi> contrary to the Truth he has ſo often acknowledged, and to the very Grounds, whereon he builds the truth of Proteſtancy. For, though I do not allow of his Grounds, yet I Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Truth of the <hi>Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Religion; which is evidently thence inferred.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:102636:28"/>
               <p>Others, to embrace the Truth, which in proceſs of time they have diſcovered, recal former Tenets, contrary thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> did: So do many, who finding Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be falſe, relinquiſh it, and embrace the <hi>Roman,</hi> oppoſite thereunto. Such men as theſe ſhew great ingenuity, and ſincerity; and by revoking ſuch Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with all Wiſe men, rather gain, than loſe Authority, or Reputation. And among theſe men Dr. <hi>St.</hi> would deſerve to be liſted, if he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to recant, and declare plainly to the world, that when he Charged the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church with <hi>Idolatry, Fanaticiſm, Diviſions in matters of Faith, danger of Salvation in her Communion,</hi> and other Corruptions, he over ſhot himſelf, as ſeveral, even of his own Friends, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs he did, at leaſt in the Charge of Idolatry.</p>
               <p>Beſides, when one recalls an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as inconſiſtent with the Truth, to which he had heretofore aſſented, he alſo virtually recalls all the proofs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, acknowledging them to be either falſe, or unconcluding. And ſince what
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102636:29"/>St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſtood to after their <hi>Retractations,</hi> contradicted what they held before, 'tis manifeſt, that their proofs, either on the one ſide or other, were void: and conſequently, recalling ſuch Opinions, they recalled alſo, their proofs of them. And here I cannot but reflect, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſeems to liſt me (<hi>pag.</hi> 14.) among ſuch as he terms <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volters from the Church of England.</hi> Thanks be to God, I was bred a <hi>Roman-Catholick:</hi> my Parents and Anceſtors were of the ſame Religion, and ſuffered much for their conſtancy therein. And I can aſſure the Dr. that for all I have ſeen in him, I am ſo far from being ſtartled in my Religion, that I am rather confirmed therein. For a weak impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Truth is a confirmation thereof: and if God ſhall be pleaſed to give me his Grace, not to quit the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Principles of Chriſtianity, I ſhall never, upon the account of what Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſaies, relinquiſh the particular Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>Many ask me, what matters it, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> palpably contradicts himſelf, and perſiſts ſo to do? which is the ſame
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102636:29"/>as if they ſhould ask me, what matters it if Dr. <hi>St.</hi> be a Madman? And to ſay the truth, it matters very little for the Publick good, that he be ſo: but it matters very much, that being ſo, he ſhould be commonly reputed a Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. For, what greater damage can be imagined, than that the people be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Madman in affairs of ſo great concern, as thoſe of Religion are? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can one do a greater ſervice to the Common-wealth, than to diſcover their Guides to be mad, if really they be ſo. Neither can there be a better way to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, than by ſhewing they grant, and perſiſt to grant, palpable Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</p>
               <p>Moreover, they might ſay the ſame, in caſe I had attacked any other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Doctor of the Proteſtant Church; (for Dr. <hi>St.</hi> carries as great a vogue as any other) asking me, what matters it, if I force ſuch a Doctor to manifeſt Contradictions; and by conſequence bring him to a <hi>Non-plus?</hi> So that were this Objection juſtifiable, it would prove, that it is of no concern, to defeat, and bring to a <hi>Non-plus</hi> any particular
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102636:30"/>Adverſary: which is certainly falſe, and repugnant to the common practice of all Learned and Zealous men.</p>
               <p>Beſides, had I proved only, that the Charges which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſaies upon us, did contradict ſome particular Tenet, held only by the Dr. and ſome few of his Partizans; though that would have been ſufficient to have baffled him, yet it would not have been of ſo great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But I have ſhewn, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſions he caſts upon us, do contradict General Principles, aſſented unto, not only by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and all <hi>Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> but alſo by all Learned Proteſtants, Members of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, and by many others of different Profeſſions: and conſequently I convince all ſuch, that the forementioned Aſperſions are falſe, as being repugnant to True and General Principles granted by them: and that whatever is produced in proof of them, is falſe, or impertinent. And what more can be required, in order to wipe of, from the minds of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the aforeſaid Calumnies!</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Other Objections Anſwered.</head>
               <p>BY what hitherto has been diſcuſs'd, it plainly appears, that the inſtance of a Lawyer at the Bar, alledged <hi>page</hi> 16. by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is of no force againſt us: Becauſe, ſhould a Lawyer produce at the Bar no other proof, but ſuch as is repugnant, not only to his own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Tenets, but alſo to the common perſwaſion of the Judges, and of all the Learned Lawyers of the Kingdom; yea and to the unanimous conſent of the Parliament; ſure his proofs would be held for frivolous. This is what ſucceeds in our preſent Caſe. Dr. <hi>St.</hi> Charges us with Crimes, repugnant, as he himſelf now admits, to this Principle, <hi>The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church is a True Church,</hi> not only granted by him, and all <hi>Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> but alſo by all Learned Divines of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, as ſuitable to her Senſe, and Doctrine, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves confeſs, and by ſeveral other of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102636:31"/>different Profeſſions. All ſuch perſons therefore (and theſe are all with whom we now diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 chunk">
                     <desc>…</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> hold the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Accuſations for void, and frivolous.</p>
               <p>Moreover, ſhould a Lawyer plead to prove one to be a notorious Traytour, and yet at the ſame time ſhould plainly declare at the Bar, that he is, and has ever been, a Loyal, and faithful Subject, could Dr. <hi>St.</hi> or any other, think, that any account were to be made of ſuch a Barriſter; who ſhould ſo openly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelf? This is what the Dr. does. He pleads to ſhew our Church to be <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> and yet at the ſame time he ſincerely confeſſes, that ſhe is a <hi>true Church,</hi> ſtanding to what he has former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted: and he admits at the preſent that the forementioned Accuſation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts this his Aſſertion, as really it does, no leſs then theſe two Propoſitions do contradict one another. <hi>Such a man is a notorious Traytour, but yet he is a faithful Subject.</hi> What account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can any prudent man make of this Accuſation of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> or conſequently of the proofs he alledges in favour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:102636:31"/>
               <p>Finally, though a Lawyer may be permitted, when required thereunto, by his Clyent, after he has informed him of his Judgment, to propoſe all the proofs he can in his favour, though his particular opinion be, that his Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent has no right to what he pretends; becauſe the Judge, who is to decide the Plea, may be of a contrary perſwaſion. Yet ſure Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will not affirm, that what he produces in his diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is only to ſhew (in order to ingratiate himſelf with the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) what may be ſaid upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and not becauſe he is of opinion, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> For if ſo, he might as well have publiſhed ſome book againſt the Divinity of our Saviour, or againſt a Deity, as he hath publiſhed the forementioned Diſcourſe, to prove the <hi>Roman</hi> Church <hi>Idolatrous;</hi> and then tell us, if he be urged, that having received a Fee from <hi>Socinians,</hi> or <hi>Atheists,</hi> he did it only to ſhew, what might be ſaid againſt the Divinity of our Saviour, or a Deity, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is of opinion that there is no
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102636:32"/>God, or that Chriſt is no God. Yea, he might ſay in like manner, that what ever he has produced hitherto, to prove the truth, and Orthodoxneſs of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, was only to ſhew (to the end he might promote his Intereſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Proteſtants) what might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in favour of their Religion; and not that he thinks it True, and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox.</p>
               <p>The Dr. ſeems to value much a Caſe he produces, <hi>pag.</hi> 20. in order to ſhew the Inſufficiency of our manner of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering him: his words are theſe; <hi>I will put a Caſe parallel to this. Suppoſe one of the Church of</hi> Judah <hi>ſhould have called the Church of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>in the time of</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>a true Church, becauſe they acknowledged the true God, and did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve an agreement in that common acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment to be ſufficient, to preſerve the Eſſentials of a Church among them; and afterwards the ſame perſon ſhould go about to convince the Ten Tribes of their Idolatry in worſhipping God by the Calves of</hi> Dan <hi>and</hi> Bethel. <hi>Would this be thought a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient way of Anſwering him, to ſay that he contradicted himſelf by granting them a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102636:32"/>True Church, and yet charging them with Idolatry? Whereas the only true Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence would be, that he thought ſome kind of Idolatry to be conſiſtent with the being of a Church.</hi> He adds, that ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might juſtly ſay, <hi>that they made a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill uſe of his Charity;</hi> and <hi>that if they could prove to him, that the Idolatry he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered upon them, did <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-church them; the Conſequence of it would be, that his Charity muſt be ſo much the leſs, and that he must deny them to be a true Church.</hi> This is Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s Caſe; whereby he pretends to evince the invalidity of our manner of Anſwering him.</p>
               <p>But before I examin this Caſe of the Dr. I will put a Caſe Parallel to ours, to ſhew, that the way we have taken to Anſwer him is ſufficient. Suppoſe that a <hi>Jew,</hi> (for why may not a <hi>Jew</hi> be as Charitable, and Zealous too, as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and yet Contradict himſelf, as he does?) ſhould, out of a pretended zeal, Charge Chriſtian Religion, even when it was in its greateſt purity, with the ſame kind of Idolatry, as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens upon us; and that notwithſtanding at the ſame time, carried away with
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102636:33"/>the like Charity, as the Dr. is, ſhould confeſs, that Chriſtian Religion was then, not only a True Religion, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Pure, Safe, and Sound Religion: and with ſuch a Religion even Dr. <hi>St.</hi> affirms, the Idolatry he Charges us with, yea all kind of Idolatry, to be inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent, as will appear hereafter. Now in this Caſe might not the Dr. in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Chriſtian Religion, ſay and prove too, (for I do not aver, as he ſeems to inſinuate, that it is enough to ſay he is guilty of ſelf-contradiction, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs one proves it) that ſuch a man did contradict himſelf, in granting Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion to be a true and ſound Religion, and yet Charging it with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry? Could he rationally ſay, that the only true Conſequence in that caſe would be, not that ſuch a perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted himſelf, but that he thought ſome kind of Idolatry to be conſiſtent, not only with the Being, but alſo with the Soundneſs of a Church? or ſhould he think ſo, would he not therefore contradict himſelf? and having proved to him, that the Idolatry he fathered upon the Chriſtian Religion, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102636:33"/>to the Soundneſs of a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would the Conſequence be, that the Charity of ſuch a perſon muſt be ſo much the leſs, and that he muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hereafter the ſoundneſs of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion? Would it not be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent way of Anſwering ſuch a man, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate unto him, that the Charge of Idolatry caſt by him upon Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was falſe; and conſequently that what ever he produced in proof thereof, was void? and to demonſtrate this unto him, would not be enough to ſhew, that ſuch a charge did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict a Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſtian Religion, true in it ſelf, and aſſented unto by both parties?</p>
               <p>This is juſt our caſe with Dr. <hi>St.</hi> For, as that <hi>Jew</hi> does contradict himſelf, by granting Chriſtian Religion to be a <hi>ſound Religion,</hi> and yet charging it with <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;</hi> So Dr. <hi>St.</hi> Contradicts himſelf, by affirming the <hi>Roman Church</hi> to be a <hi>true Church,</hi> and yet <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> as we have proved, and he now admits: and as it would doubtleſs be a ſufficient way of anſwering that <hi>Jew,</hi> to prove unto him, that the charge of Idolatry he laid
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102636:34"/>upon Chriſtian Religion, was falſe, as contradicting a Principle true in it ſelf, and aſſented unto by both parties: So the way we have taken to anſwer Dr. <hi>St.</hi> being the very ſame, muſt needs be ſufficient: and finally the Quibbles Dr. <hi>St.</hi> makes at our manner of Anſwering are, or might be made, by the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Jew,</hi> at the like manner of Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; and conſequently they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant in both Caſes, or in neither.</p>
               <p>Now to the Caſe propoſed by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> my Anſwer is, That it would be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient way to Anſwer that perſon of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> for thoſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to prove to him, as the eaſily might, that if the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was, in thoſe times, a True Church, as they both affirmed, though erroneouſly, it was not Idolatrous: and that if it was not Idolatrous, what ever he alledged to prove it ſuch, was void, and of no force. This, I ſay, would have been a ſufficient way of Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that perſon of <hi>Judah;</hi> but not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who deny, as we do, the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to have retained, in that time, the Eſſentials of a true Church: and it is no wonder, that what is a ſufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102636:34"/>to one, be not a ſufficient Anſwer to another; Becauſe different Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries go upon different Principles.</p>
               <p>Let's now ſee, what Anſwer the Dr. makes to the Inſtance I produced, of a <hi>Witneſs,</hi> pag. 1.14. who being once Convinced of <hi>Self-Contradiction</hi> in the evidence he alledges, renders himſelf unworthy to be heard any more in the Court; at leaſt till he has repaired his Reputation; and whatever he produces void and of no force: Beſides, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign puniſhment he is liable unto. To this Dr. <hi>St.</hi> Anſwers, ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, as has been hinted above, <hi>page</hi> 15. <hi>That Self contradiction, being proved, overthrows the Authority of the perſon, who ſtands convicted thereof,</hi> and <hi>where things depend meerly upon Authority,</hi> it <hi>is a good Argument; and nowhere elſe.</hi> I willingly accept of what Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally grants; and hence conclude, that if he contradicts himſelf, (as we both now ſuppoſe he does) all his Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and all the Arguments he grounds upon them, (and he has ſcarce any Argument, which is not grounded upon ſome Quotation or other) ſignifie
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102636:35"/>nothing, becauſe they depend meerly upon his Authority; which, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, is overthrown by Self-contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: neither does he deſerve to be heard any more in matters that depend of Authority, till he has recruited his Credit. All this, according to Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s own confeſſion, follows from Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction once proved againſt him. And though one may ſeek out the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies he aledges in their proper foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; at leaſt till then, and till one has found them to be faithfully quoted, (and who has examined all his Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?) he is not bound to give any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit unto them: and ſhould one take the pains to examin the Teſtimonies he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges in their proper places, he would eaſily ſee, that they are either frivolous, or falſe; as the Learned Author of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks no Idolaters,</hi> who was pleaſed to examin ſome of them, has already part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered.</p>
               <p>Beſides no body in prudence can think himſelf bound to examin in their proper places, the allegations of one, who is evidently convicted of Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction: As for inſtance (to go on
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102636:35"/>in the ſame ſimilitude of a Witneſs) ſhould one, before a judge, impeach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of High-Treaſon, and in proof thereof name the complices, and alledg, that there might be found in ſuch a place of his houſe, ſtore of Armes, and in his Cloſet Letters of ſecret Intelligence with Rebels, and Traitours; yet withal ſhould manifeſtly contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, averring before the ſame Judge, and at the ſame time, that the perſon, whom he impeached of Treaſon, was, and had always been, a faithful Subject to his Majeſty: Can Dr. <hi>St.</hi> imagin in this caſe, that ſuch a judge would be bound, upon the meer Teſtimony of a Witneſs, who had ſo palpably Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted himſelf, to ſend Officers to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Conſpiratours named by him, and to ſearch the houſe of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon impeached, to ſee whether what the Witneſs alledged, was true or not? or rather, that he ought not in prudence to look upon the Evidence of ſuch a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as null, and of no force; no leſs than if a Madman had put in the like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation. And yet ſuch a Witneſs might plead for himſelf in the ſame terms,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102636:36"/>wherein Dr. <hi>St.</hi> pretends to vindicate his own proceedings.</p>
               <p>For he might ſay, <hi>That though he ſhould contradict himſelf, it does not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow, (as certainly it does not) that all his Evidences are falſe, and whatever he ſhall hereafter ſay in the ſame matter, invalid. That he never was ſo vain, as to make uſe of his own authority, to prove a thing to be true, becauſe he believ'd it; or that his ſaying alone makes a thing to be true. That he does not deſire any one to follow his Opinion, becauſe it is his; but he offers evidences for proof of what he ſaies aſſigning the places, where they may find manifeſt Arguments of Treaſon. That if theſe be good, and true in themſelves, they do not therefore ceaſe to be ſo, becauſe they are inconſiſtent with what he ſaies in favour of the perſon he impeaches. That ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as are conſtituted by publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as all Judges are, to provide for the ſecurity of his Majeſties Royal Perſon, when they hear one impeached of High Treaſon, the Complices nominated, and the place aſſigned, where the Instruments of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration may be found, ought not preſently to conclude, all theſe Allegations are falſe,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102636:36"/>and of no force, meerly becauſe the perſon who makes uſe of them, does judge ſo chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably of the Traitour, as to ſuppoſe, he ſtill retains the Eſſentials of a Faithful Subject; and that therefore they make very ill uſe of his Charity; but however, that they are more concern'd in proving the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he impeached, not guilty of Treaſon, than he is in defending his Charitable O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of him: That what they will get by charging him with Contradiction, is only, that hereafter he ſhall not think ſo Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the perſons he impeaches. Finally, that when he ſaies, that ſuch a perſon, whom he impeaches, is a Traitour, but yet a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and loyal Subject, the only true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that thence may be inferred, is, not that he contradicts himſelf, but that he thinks, ſome kind of High-Treaſon to be conſiſtent with Loyalty; and that if they could prove to him, all ſorts of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be inconſiſtent with Loyalty, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of it would be, that his Charity muſt be ſo much the leſs, but the danger would be the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold here the Vindication of the forementioned Witneſs, drawn up in the ſame terms, and upon the ſame
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102636:37"/>grounds, whereon Dr. <hi>St.</hi> in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, builds his own Vindication. And yet what prudent man is there, that would not look upon the aforeſaid Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of a Witneſs, convicted of ſuch a manifeſt Self-contradiction, as frivolous and inſignificant? Yea, we have ſhewed already, upon another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that on ſuppoſition he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himſelf <hi>in the way I inſiſt upon,</hi> all his Arguments grounded either upon Authority, or meer Reaſon (if he has any ſuch) wherewith he pretends to make good the Charges caſt upon us, are falſe, or impertinent. The ſame is to be affirmed of whatever he ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after object againſt our Church in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith; as long as he holds it to be a True Church. For nothing can be objected againſt our Church in that kind, which does not contradict the forementioned Principle.</p>
               <p>Now 'tis very pretty to conſider, how the Dr. ſports with the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned inſtance of a Witneſs, whereof I made uſe; grounding all his quibbles upon ſo groſs an ignorance, as is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <hi>Parities</hi> with <hi>identities,</hi> and the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102636:37"/>being one thing like to another, with being the ſame: which Topick is very frequent in the Dr.'s Books. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Witneſs muſt make an <hi>Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit</hi> before the Maſters of the Chancery, he preſently fancies, that a Writer of Controverſies, ſuppoſing this parity to be good, muſt make an <hi>Affidavit,</hi> and no other Obligation will ſuffice him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Maſters of the Court of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies: and becauſe whatever is ſaid by a Witneſs at the Bar, is taken upon his Oath, he imagins, in the ſame ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that whatever a Writer of Controverſie ſaies, muſt be taken alſo upon his Oath, and in no other manner: and becauſe a Witneſs, who ſtands Convicted to have forſworn himſelf, according to the Laws of this Kingdom, is to be ſet in the Pillory, <hi>p.</hi> 27. with his Accuſation on his Forehead, he imagines himſelf, as being proved guilty of Self-contradiction, to be ſet in the Pillory, with this Accuſation on his forehead, <hi>Dr. Stillingfleet againſt Dr. Stillingfleet;</hi> not being able to conceive, that any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther puniſhment can be inflicted upon one, who contradicts himſelf in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102636:38"/>of moment. Are not theſe Fancies of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> wonderfully witty? what fine Stuff will the Dr. make with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein Chriſt is compared to a Worm, to a Door, to a Lamb, to Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to ſeveral other things, infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly below his Greatneſs, if he be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to uſe this manner of quibbling, and to make <hi>identities,</hi> of <hi>parities,</hi> or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables.</p>
               <p>Had not the Dr. made it his Study not to underſtand us, he might clearly have ſeen, that what we intended by the aforeſaid inſtance was, that whoever ſtands convicted to have Contradicted himſelf moſt notoriouſly in matters of ſo great concern, as thoſe of Religion are, deſerves no credit ſhould be given him in ſuch matters, till he has recanted his Errour; which the Dr. himſelf does grant. I am not acquainted with the Stile of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, nor of our Univerſities; yet I conceive, that there would be no abſurdity, nor any thing done contrary to the practice of other Countries, and Univerſities, that Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of Divinity, and publick Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſhould take their Oath, to Teach
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102636:38"/>and Preach the Truth in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: And in this Caſe, ſhould they palpably contradict themſelves, they would be guilty of Perjury. And though they do not take their Oaths, yet a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Obligation lies upon every one, not to commit groſs Contradictions in matters of ſo high concern.</p>
               <p>Some there are, who though they confeſs, that the way we have taken is ſufficient to confound our Adverſaries; yet becauſe they think we argue <hi>ad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem,</hi> they do not look upon this way as effectual, to clear the <hi>Roman</hi> Church from the Aſperſions caſt upon her: For Arguments <hi>ad hominem</hi> are good to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found an Adverſarie, but not to evince the Truth.</p>
               <p>To this I Anſwer, that an Argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> properly ſpeaking, is, when one proceeds upon a Principle, which he judges to be falſe; yet becauſe it is granted by his Adverſary, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to confute him thereby. As for example, when a Catholick argues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Proteſtant, out of ſuch Verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Proteſtant Bible, which are falſe, and contrary to the Chatholick
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102636:39"/>Bible, to confute the particular Tenets of Proteſtancy: whence I conclude, that the way I made uſe of againſt Dr. <hi>St.</hi> was not properly <hi>ad hominem:</hi> For I proceeded upon a Principle, which I my ſelf, with all other <hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi> and ſeveral others of different profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hold to be true; <hi>viz. The Roman Church is a true Church;</hi> and which is granted by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> Neither is it of any concern, that ſome deny the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be a true Church; For if all Arguments are <hi>ad hominem,</hi> which are grounded upon ſome premiſe, that is denied by ſome, almoſt all Arguments are <hi>ad hominem.</hi> For what is there, that ſome do not deny? Should I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated all Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s Objections out of plain Scripture, admitted both by him and us, no body could rationally have objected, that I did argue only <hi>ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> or ſlight my proofs upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: and yet how many are there, that deny the very Scripture; which we, and Dr. <hi>St.</hi> agree upon!</p>
               <p>To cloſe up therefore the firſt part of my Reply; By what hitherto has been laid down, it evidently appears, that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102636:39"/>
                  <hi>on ſuppoſition Dr.</hi> St. <hi>contradicts himſelf in the way I inſict upon,</hi> not only all the Charges, of Idolatry, Fanatiſciſme, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Salvation in our Communion, and Diviſions in matters of Faith, which he pretends to faſten upon our Church, fall to nothing; but alſo all the proofs, whether drawen from Authority, or Reaſon, wherewith he endeavours to make good ſuch Charges, are invalida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and annull'd: which is all I did pretend in my Anſwer to the Dr. and whether this be not a ſufficient Anſwer to his Book, I leave to the judgment of any judicious man whatſoever. Yea the Dr. himſelf, being Conſcious (as it ſeems) how ill a cauſe he had, ſhould he grant himſelf guilty of Self-contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in matters of ſo great Concern; paſſing to the ſecond part of his pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Anſwer, ſaies thus, <hi>pag.</hi> 17. <hi>I had beſt ſtand upon my defence, and utterly deny that I have contradicted my ſelf in any thing, in which</hi> J Ws. <hi>has charged me.</hi> And to paſs alſo unto the ſecond part of my Reply, let's now conſider, how he does vindicate himſelf from the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions charged upon him.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> The Evaſions of the Dr. to clear himſelf from Self-contradiction, in Charging the <hi>Roman</hi> Church with Idolatry; Examined.</head>
               <p>COncerning the clearing himſelf from Contradiction, in imputing to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church Idolatry, and yet granting her to be a True Church, he ſaies, <hi>pag.</hi> 18. <hi>That he never vindicated the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>from Idolatry,</hi> in his Defence of Archbiſhop <hi>Lawd;</hi> which is the Book, wherein he confeſſes the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to be a true Church.</hi> But what does he mean by ſaying, <hi>That he never vindicated the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>from Idolatry?</hi> does he mean, that he never writ any Treatiſe on this Subject? That I confeſs to be true. But ſure, to commit Contradiction 'tis not neceſſary to have written Treatiſes in vindication of each, or either part of the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Had he ſaid in expreſs terms, <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is a true Church,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102636:40"/>and is not a true Church,</hi> would he not have Contradicted himſelf, unleſs he had publiſhed Books, or Treatiſes, in defence of the one or the other part of ſuch a palpable Contradiction, as this? To Contradict ones ſelf 'tis enough to affirm, and to deny the ſame thing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he has never writ, or produced Arguments to prove the one or the other part. Does he therefore mean, that in defence of Archbiſhop <hi>Lawd,</hi> he has not laid down any Principle, nor aſſerted any thing; which, if true, does not clear the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from Idolatry: and conſequently contradicts the Charg he laies upon her, in his Diſcourſe of Idolatry? This I have ſhewn to be falſe; becauſe in the Defence of Archbiſhop <hi>Lawd,</hi> he grants <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to be a true Church:</hi> which conceſſion does evidently clear her from Idolatry, wherewith he charges her in his other Book: neither has he yet vindicated himſelf from this Contradiction; as we ſhall ſee by examining the ſhifts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he pretends to clear himſelf, <hi>pag.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>He adds in the ſame place, that it fell out very happily, that in his Defence of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102636:41"/>Archbiſhop <hi>Lawd, pag.</hi> 596.606. he had made a Diſcourſe to the ſame purpoſe, proving the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> guilty of Idolatry, in the Invocation of Saints, and the Worſhip of Images. But what does this help to ſhew, that what he ſaies in his Defence of Archbiſhop <hi>Lawd</hi> does not contradict what he Aſſerts in his Diſcourſe of Idolatry; which is his main deſign in the preſent Anſwer? Is not this, as if one ſhould have affirmed, what Dr. <hi>St. ſaies in one part of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe of the Archbiſhop, does contradict what he ſaies in another part of the ſame Book. Therefore what he ſaies in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Archbiſhop, does not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict what he aſſerts in his Diſcourſe of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry?</hi> Is not Dr. <hi>St.</hi> like to have a good cauſe, if ſuch Inferences as theſe be warrantable. To contradict himſelf in the very ſelf ſame Book is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable, and can be no medium to prove, that he does not contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in different Books. Neither was I ignorant of the forementioned contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, committed by him in his former Book: but becauſe my Deſign in <hi>Dr. Stillingfleet againſt Dr. Stillingfleet</hi> was,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102636:41"/>to annul the Charges laid upon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church in his Diſcourſe of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I took notice only of the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction betwen his former Book and latter Diſcourſe; never intending to deny, that in the ſame book he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelf. For the Dr. does ſo ſtuff up his works with Contradictions, that it is not neceſſary to turn over many Books, nay nor many Chapters, nor (ſometimes) many leaves, to meet with them.</p>
               <p>He ſaies farther in the ſame page 18. that I do not pretend to gather out of his Books <hi>any Contradiction in Terms,</hi> or a <hi>Formal Affirmation and Negation of the ſame Object;</hi> but only <hi>by Conſequence:</hi> and I deſire to know of him, whether, if I do ſhew, as I have already ſhewn, That what he aſſerts in his <hi>Rational Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi> does by good Conſequence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict, and annul the Charges laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us in his <hi>Diſcourſe of Idolatry;</hi> All thoſe Inferences mentioned above, which follow from Self-contradiction <hi>in the way I inſiſt upon,</hi> do not by good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence fall heavy upon him? and if ſo, whether this be not enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute him?</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:102636:42"/>
               <p>To declare the better the inanity of theſe Evaſions he makes uſe of, to Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himſelf from Contradictions; let us put caſe, that one, who heretofore had confeſt Dr. <hi>St.</hi> to be an Honeſt man; ſhould now, upon ſome pick, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though retaining yet the former good opinion of his honeſty, affirm him to be a Knave; and that ſome of the Dr.'s Friends, to vindicate him from ſo foul an Aſperſion, ſhould charge his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, as juſtly they might, with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, in affirming Dr. <hi>St.</hi> to be an Honeſt man, and yet a Knave; can he, or any one elſe, imagin, that ſuch a man would ſufficiently clear himſelf from the Crime of Contradiction, by ſaying, <hi>That he never vindicated the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty of Dr.</hi> St. <hi>although he has heretoſore, and did ſtill, hold him to be an Honest man; That it had happily fallen out, that when heretofore he acknowledged him to be an honeſt man, even at the ſame time he had publiſhed him for a Knave; and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that to ſay he is an Honeſt man, and yet a Knave, is no</hi> Formal Contradiction <hi>in</hi> terms,; <hi>ſince he does not</hi> Formally <hi>ſay that he is, and is not, an Honeſt man; or
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102636:42"/>affirm, and deny the ſame thing?</hi> This Caſe is parallel to the Vindication Dr. <hi>St.</hi> makes here for himſelf; and ſo clear, that any one, without difficulty, may make the Application: And yet there is no more Contradiction in affirming that one is an Honeſt man, and yet a Knave, than in ſaying, that the ſame Church is a True Church, and yet Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous: and the Contradiction in both Caſes is ſo palpable, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to any one, who underſtands what he ſaies, without needing to draw it out by Conſequences.</p>
               <p>In the next page, in order to the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clearing himſelf from Self-contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, <hi>pag.</hi> 19. he carges me with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuity; becauſe (forſooth) as he ſaies, <hi>I barely oppoſe a judgment of Charity concerning our Church,</hi> (ſuch he ſtiles this Conceſſion of his, <hi>The Roman Church is a true Church</hi>) to <hi>a judgment of Reaſon concerning the nature of Actions:</hi> and ſuch he will needs have this his Aſſertion to be, <hi>The Roman Church is an Idolatrous Church.</hi> Is not this a pretty way to ſave all Contradictions, let them be never ſo palpable? For, in all Contradictions the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102636:43"/>one part is favourable; which upon thaat ccount may be called a Judgment of Charity, or Kindneſs; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, according to this excellent Principle of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> cannot without Diſingenuity, be put in oppoſition to the other part, which is grounded, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be grounded, upon other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; for both parts of a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot have the ſame enducements. Suppoſe, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> had expreſsly granted <hi>The Roman Church to be, and not to be an Idolatrous Church;</hi> (which, ſure, is to grant palpable Contradictions, if it is poſſible, that there ſhould be any ſuch) would the Dr. in this Caſe think it a ſatisfactory Anſwer to ſay, That the one of theſe Judgments is of Charity, and the other of Reaſon? and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, one cannot be oppoſite to the other? and to urge the inſtance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced above, ſhould one be charged with Self-contradiction, for aſſerting Dr. <hi>St.</hi> to be an Honeſt man, and yet a Knave, certainly no prudent perſon can think, that ſuch a one would ſufficiently clear himſelf by ſaying, That he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be an Honeſt man out of meer
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102636:43"/>kindneſs, but that he affirmed him to be a Knave upon good and ſolid Reaſon: and that therefore no body could, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſingenuity oppoſe the one Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the other. Theſe pittiful ſhifts of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> make one exclaim, <hi>O how unhappy a thing it is to engage in a bad Cauſe! What will not ſome ſay, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than unſay themſelves, and confeſs their Errours!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, either Dr. <hi>St.</hi> thinks this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of his, <hi>The Roman Church is a true Church,</hi> to be grounded upon good, and ſolid Reaſon, as really it is, or he does not think it ſuch: now if he think it ſuch, it is not a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Charity only, but of Reaſon alſo; and conſequently, he unjuſtly charges me with diſingenuity, for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a Judgment of meer Charity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Judgment of Reaſon; ſince both, in his opinion, are Judgments of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. If he does not think this his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to be grounded upon Reaſon, how can it be a Judgment of true, and real Charity? Can it be true Charity to tell us, That we are in a true way to Salvation, That our Church does not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102636:44"/>teach us any damnable Errour, or any thing deſtructive to our Eternal Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; and yet to tell us all this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Reaſon to think it ſo? Such a Charity of this, if it muſt be called ſo, is rather a meer Cheat, than Charity. Nay, ſince the Dr. has declared himſelf an implacable Enemy to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, beſpattering her with ſo many foul Aſperſions, 'tis not credible, he would grant her to be a True church, did not good, and ſolid Reaſons force him thereunto: and we have ſeen above, that the very ſame grounds, whereby he pretends to eſtabliſh the Truth of the Proteſtant Church, evince alſo the Truth of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. So that he muſt either confeſs, That he grants his own Church to be true out of meer Charity, without any ſolid ground for to grant it; or he muſt acknowledge our Church to be a true Church upon good, and ſolid Reaſons, at leaſt in his Opinion.</p>
               <p>And becauſe Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and his Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates do ſo often vapour of their Charity, in allowing <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Salvation; endeavouring (ſome
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102636:44"/>of them) thence to prove, That their Religion is better than ours, which does not allow ſo much to Proteſtants, 'twill not be amiſs, to examin the depth of this their Charity: and ſure, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how thoſe, who deny our Church to be a true Church, are puzzled, and to what ſhifts they are put, concerning the continuation of the True Church for ſo many years before <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin;</hi> their Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, and ſeveral other points of higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, objected againſt them; we may prudently believe, that when they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our Church to be a true Church, they do it not ſo much out of any kindneſs they have for us; as for their own proper Intereſt, and Concern.</p>
               <p>Again, if that Religion has the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Charity, and upon that account is to be held for the beſt Religion, that makes the way of Salvation wideſt, the Religion of the <hi>Libertines,</hi> and <hi>Latitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarians,</hi> who affirm all Religions to be true, and ſufficient to Salvation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Chriſtianiſm, Judaiſm, Paganiſm,</hi> or <hi>Mahometiſm,</hi> would be the beſt of all Religions: which certainly Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102636:45"/>never grant, although he burns with ſo great Charity. Moreover, leaving both parties, Catholicks and Proteſtants, to their proper Tenets, 'tis greater Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Catholicks towards Proteſtants, to tell them they are in the wrong, than in Proteſtants towards Catholicks, to tell them they are in the right, or in a true way to Salvation. For the moſt that Proteſtants can effect in Catholicks with this their Conceſſion, is to encourage them to go on with more alacrity in the way, wherein they are; ſince they ſee, that even their greateſt Enemies do grant them to be in a true way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: when as Catholicks, by telling Proteſtants they are in the wrong, may bring many of them to the right, and ſave them from Damnation: Since they cannot but be much moved, ſeeing that ſo many Learned men, who are ten to one for Proteſtants, do affirm with ſo great aſſeveration, and conſtancy, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſeveral ſolid grounds, in proof of what they affirm, <hi>That proteſtants are in the wrong way.</hi> And beyond debate it is far greater Charity to ſave one from Damnation, than only to encourage
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102636:45"/>him to obtain his Salvation: So it is greater Charity to tell one, whom we know to be out of the way, That he is in the wrong; than to tell one, whom we know to be in the true way, That he is in the right: Becauſe the one, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be told of his Errour, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably go on, and never come whither he intended: when as the other, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by our advice, will only come ſooner to his journey's end: whither he would have arrived, although we had told him nothing.</p>
               <p>Beſides, when our Adverſaries are pinched with the inferences we deduce from this their Conceſſion, they do ſo mince, and clip their Charity, that it ſcarce retains any ſhew or mark thereof, as appears by what Archbiſhop <hi>Lawd,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and others, aſſert in this matter. For they ſay, That all Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men among us are damned, if they continue in Communion with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church: Nay the ſame they affirm of all thoſe, who underſtand the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Abſurdities, they are pleaſed to oppoſe againſt us: which in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are ſo clear, and manifeſt, that no
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102636:46"/>body, who is not a meer Fool, or a Madman, and conſequently in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not capable of Malice, may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand them: That ſcarce any one is ſaved amongſt us; That only an invincible ignorance, which is not eaſily preſumed in matters ſo clear, (as they will needs have our Errours to be, and wherein every one is ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd) can excuſe us from eternal Damnation: That we are all flat Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and as groſs, as the groſſeſt of the Heathen; and by conſequence, That this Propoſition, <hi>A Roman-Catholick may be ſaved,</hi> hath no more truth in it than this, <hi>An Idolater may be ſaved:</hi> Finally, that <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> may be ſaved upon condition they repent of their Errours; as alſo <hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> may be ſaved upon the like Condition.</p>
               <p>Now if we compare with theſe their Aſſertions concerning <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> what we affirm of Proteſtants, in order to their Salvation or Damnation, we ſhall evidently ſee, that there is little or no difference between us and them in relation to this point; and that they have no cauſe to make ſuch Bravadoe's
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102636:46"/>of their Charity towards us. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two Propoſitions, ſcarce any one is ſaved, and all are damned, there is ſo ſcant a difference, that there is very little reaſon to boaſt thereof. Neither do we deny, but that ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants have an invincible ignorance of the Errours of their Religion; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently upon that account are no leſs excuſable from Damnation, than they ſay we are. Beſides, Catholicks do not affirm, That thoſe Proteſtants, who are in a condition not capable of Malice, as meer Fools, Madmen, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, are more liable to damnation, than Catholicks of the ſame condition: Yet farther, we never aſſert that this Propoſition Proteſtants are damned, has more truth in it, than this, Idolaters are damned: and conſequently it is as true, That a Proteſtant may be ſaved, as that an Idolater may be ſaved. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we deny, but Proteſtants may be ſaved if they repent. Where then is the difference between their Charity and ours, that may give them any cauſe of Vapouring?</p>
               <p>In Fine, if things be well conſidered,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102636:47"/>it will manifeſtly appeare, That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants damn more Catholicks, than Catholicks do Proteſtants. For it is certain, that there are at leaſt twenty Roman-Catholicks in the world for one Proteſtant of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church; with which is our preſent debate. Now ſince they affirm, that ſcarce any Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick is ſaved, let's put the caſe, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one in twenty is ſaved, and all the reſt are damned; according to this computation, they damn nineteen, where we damn one; Suppoſing that we damn all Proteſtants, or believe them to be damned, if they continue in that Profeſſion; and they ſcarce ſave any Chatholick, or believe him to be ſaved, if he lives and dies in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. So that concerning the Damnation, or Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Contrary Party, we have more reaſon to glory of our Charity, than they. And hence evidently appears the inanity of their pretended Charity, which they often caſt in our Teeth; this being a common Topick, whence they have framed many Sermons, and Diſcourſes againſt us.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:102636:47"/>
               <p>Yet I cannot deny, but that the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is enhanced to a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: For he has made the bounds of the True Church ſo wide, that it contains not only the moſt notorious Hereticks, but alſo the greateſt Idolaters. Was it not therefore very ill done of me, to make ſo bad a uſe of ſo wonderful a Charity? And all this he does out of his exceeding great kindneſs for Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion; and becauſe he cannot find a way, how to bring her within the verge of the True Church, without letting in with her the groſſeſt Idolaters of the world, both in Doctrine and Practice. But whether Proteſtants will think themſelves bound to render the Dr. Thanks for his exceſs of his Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I leave it to the judgment of the Learned, and Zealous men amongſt them. One ſtep only is wanting, to make this Charity perfect indeed; and that is, to enlarge the Pale of the True Church ſo far, as that it may take in flat Atheiſts: which he may do with as much eaſe, as he does other things.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>pages</hi> 19, 20, 21, 22. he min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles many things, which do not tend to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102636:48"/>prove, that he does not contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, (which was the proper ſubject in this ſecond part of his Anſwer) but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that on ſvppoſition he ſhould contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himſelf in the way I inſiſt upon, yet this would not be a ſatisfactory anſwer, nor annull the Reaſons he produced in order to make good the charges he laies againſt us: All which has been already anſwered above in the firſt part of our Reply. As concerning his Vindication from Self-contradiction, he ſaies, <hi>pag.</hi> 20, 21 That by granting us a True Church, and yet charging us with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, it does not follow, That he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts himſelf, but the only true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is, That he thinks ſome kind of Idolatry conſiſtent with the Being of a True Church. For <hi>what ſhadow of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction is it</hi> (they are the Dr.'s words <hi>pag.</hi> 21.) <hi>to ſay, That the Roman Church is a true Church, and yet is guilty of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, ſuppoſing he believes ſome ſort of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, which is very ſinful, not to be yet of ſo high a nature, as to unchurch thoſe that practiſe it.</hi> A ſtrange Anſwer! ſo that if one has ſo good an opinion of himſelf, (and who has not?) as to believe, or
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102636:48"/>think, that what he affirms is, in ſome ſort, conſiſtent with what he denies, let him affirm or deny what he pleaſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this admirable evaſion of <hi>Dr. Stillingfleet,</hi> he will be free from Self-contradiction: Whoever joynes two terms, that really contradict one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whatever he thinks, he commits a Contradiction. Should one affirm ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be a notorious Traitor, but yet a Loyal Subject, (which is the inſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove inſinuated) could the Dr. pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſay in this caſe, that ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon did not contradict himſelf, but that the only true conſequence, that hence might be inferred, was, That he thought ſome ſort of notorious Treaſon to be conſiſtent with Loyalty? or could he juſtly exclaim, <hi>What ſhadow of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is it to ſay, That one is a notorious Traitor, but yet a Loyal Subject;</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that who ſaies this, believes ſome ſort of Treaſon, though very notorious, not to be yet of ſo high a nature, as to deſtroy Loyalty?</p>
               <p>Neither ſhould the Dr. have ſuppoſed <hi>pag.</hi> 22. (as he does) but proved, that the Idolatry introduced by <hi>Jeroborm</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102636:49"/>the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> was not deſtructive to the being of a True Church. Several proteſtants, among other precedents, produce the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> infected with the Idolatry of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to ſhew, that the true viſible Church may ceaſe: and conſequently, they believed the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to have ceaſed to be a true Church, by reaſon of the Idolatry ſhe committed; otherwiſe they could never have made uſe of the ſaid inſtance to that intent: and accordingly they look't upon that Idolatry, as deſtructive to the Being of a True Church. For how can a Church ceaſe to be true, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of an Idolatry, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the Being of a True Church? Yea the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. does, not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, inſinuate, that the Idolatry practiſed by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did unchurch them; yet they were not all infected therewith. For God told <hi>Elias,</hi> when he complained, that <hi>he was left alone in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, that ſeven thouſand of them had not bowed their knees unto Baal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Evaſions produced hitherto by the Dr. are, as we have ſeen, ineffectual to clear him from Self-contradiction;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102636:49"/>and ſuch as, had they any force in them, would prove it impoſſible, that any one ſhould contradict himſelf; eſpecially, if he believed he does not; which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently falſe. So that the Dr. to ſhew himſelf guiltleſs of Self-contradiction, takes the ſame way, as if to prove himſelf an honeſt man, he ſhould alledge no better Reaſons, than ſuch as prove, (if they prove any thing) that there have never been, nor are, any Knaves in the world; but that all are, and have been, honeſt men. But this is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Artifice of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> So that he may produce any Arguments that ſeem to prove his intent, he cares not what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe they prove with the ſame force; and ſo he may ſhoot home, he matters not, how much he over ſhoots himſelf: though one may miſs as much of the mark by being gone, as by being ſhort. And although the Dr. has been adviſed of the Nullity of this manner of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to that Maxime, an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that proves too much, proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> yet hitherto he has not thought it for his purpoſe to take notice of it.</p>
               <p>In the ſame <hi>page</hi> 22. the Dr. affirms,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102636:50"/>that <hi>although they do allow the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to be a true Church, they are far from underſtanding by that a Sound, or a good Church:</hi> but mean no more by it, than as a man is a true man, though he hath the Plague upon him. Neither did I ever ſay, (<hi>Dr. St. ag. Dr. St. pag.</hi> 3.) that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> expreſsly affirmed, that our Church is a <hi>Sound Church,</hi> but only that he granted it to be a <hi>True Church:</hi> which neither now does he deny, or queſtion. For, among other things, I alledged out of the Dr. in order to this purpoſe, I affirmed, that he held our Church <hi>to be a true way to Heaven,</hi> but not a <hi>ſafe way;</hi> which ſignifies here the ſame, as a <hi>true</hi> Church, but not a <hi>ſound</hi> Church. Now Dr. <hi>St.</hi> does plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that it is a Contradiction to ſay, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is a <hi>Sound</hi> Church, and yet an <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Church: which (<hi>viz.</hi> had he granted our Church to be <hi>Sound</hi>) <hi>would be</hi> as he ſaies, <hi>p.</hi> 23. <hi>the moſt proper ſenſe to found a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon, in this matter of Idolatry.</hi> For he freely grants, that all ſorts of Idolatry are inconſiſtent with the <hi>Soundneſs</hi> of a Church; but not with the <hi>Truth</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:102636:50"/>
               <p>Wherefore, if I can evince, That all ſorts of Idolatry are at leaſt that ſort of Idolatry, which he faſtens upon <hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi> is deſtructive, not only to the <hi>Soundneſs,</hi> but alſo to the <hi>Truth</hi> of a Church; and that an Idolatrous Church is not as a man ſick of the Plague, who may retain the Eſſentials of a man: if (I ſay) I can evince this, it will be a contradiction, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſay, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is a <hi>Sound</hi> Church, and yet an <hi>Idolatrous;</hi> but alſo to affirm, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is a <hi>True</hi> Church, and yet <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous;</hi> at leaſt with ſuch a kind of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> laies upon her: for which ſee.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The Doctor palpably Contradicts himſelf in affirming the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, and yet granting her to be a True Church.</head>
               <p>WHen my Book firſt appeared in publick, ſeveral Zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, who had been pleaſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe it, were ſo firmly perſwaded, that there is a palpable Contradiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two Propoſitions, <hi>The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church is a True Church, The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church is an Idolatrous Church;</hi> and being moreover ſenſible, what an affront it is for any one eſpecially for Lerned men, to grant, and perſiſt to grant pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Contradictions, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believe, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> whom they applauded ſo much for his Learning, had ever granted the two forementioned Propoſitions. Beſides, they being not able to deny, but that he aſſerted <hi>The Roman Church to be an Idolatrous Church,</hi> ſeeing he had written a whole Traetiſe of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102636:51"/>that Subject, they concluded, that he had never granted <hi>The Roman Church to be a True Church,</hi> although I quoted out of him ſeveral plain places to that intent.</p>
               <p>But now Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has done me juſtice, and has cleared all doubts, if any might be in this matter; ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, that he has heretofore, and does ſtill affirm <hi>The Roman Church to be a true Church.</hi> And why ſhould he plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that he had affirmed any ſuch thing ſo diſadvantagious unto him, were it not ſo manifeſt he had done ſo, that it could not be queſtioned? eſpecially, when he is forced to winde himſelf all the waies he can to diſentangle the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction objected againſt him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as had he never granted <hi>the Roman Church to be a true Church,</hi> all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Self contradiction in this point would have vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>Nay, he confirms clearly he ſame Doctrine in ſeveral places of this his Examination of my Book. For <hi>pag.</hi> 21. he ſaies thus; <hi>We acknowledg that they</hi> (Roman Catholicks) <hi>ſtill retain the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental. Articles of the Chriſtian Faith; That there is no diſpute between them and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102636:52"/>us about the True God, and his Son, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, as to his Death, Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Glory, and being the proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Divine Worſhip. We yeild, that they have true Baptiſm among them, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: and we looking upon theſe, as the Eſſentials of a true Church, do upon that account own that Church to be ſo.</hi> Where, without doubt he judges the points here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to be all the Fundamental and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential points of a true Church: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he would not own our Church to be a true Church preciſely, becauſe ſhe holds the forementioned points. For a Church that fails but in one Eſſential point of a true Church, although it be the leaſt of all, is no true Church.</p>
               <p>[And here by the way I cannot but Advertiſe, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> without (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) reflecting on it, has ſet down a particular Catalogue of all the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental points of the True Religion: which proteſtants commonly are loth to do.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 23. he ſaies, <hi>Thoſe which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Eſſentials of a Church, we deny not to it,</hi> that is, to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:102636:52"/>and a Church, that retains all the <hi>Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials</hi> of a true Church, muſt needs be ſo. In the ſame place he compares our Church, over-run, as he ſaies, <hi>with ſuch Corruptions in Worſhip,</hi> to a man that has the Plague upon him; who yet ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a true man. <hi>Pag.</hi> 22. <hi>when we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>the Church of Rome to be a True Church, we are far from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by that a ſound, or good Church:</hi> which words expreſsly ſignifie, that he and his Partizans allow our Church to be a True Church: which is all we now pretend. But more at large he confirms this Doctrine, <hi>pag.</hi> 29. §. 4. where he has in the Margin theſe words, <hi>In what ſenſe the Church of Rome is owned by him, and other Protestants as a true Church:</hi> which manifeſtly imports, that they own her as ſuch. <hi>Pag.</hi> 30. he ſpeaks thus, <hi>Whatever Church owns thoſe things, which are Antecedently neceſſary to the Being of a Church, cannot ſo long ceaſe to be a true Church.</hi> and in the ſame page, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before, he inſinuates, that thoſe things only are neceſſary Antecedently to the Being of a Church, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be believed in order to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102636:53"/>and <hi>pag.</hi> 31. he ſaies, <hi>Nothing ought to be owned as neceſſary to Salvation by Chriſtian Societies, but ſuch things which by all thoſe Societies</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Societies, and conſequently by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who is one of them) <hi>are abknowledged antecedently neceſsary to the Being of the Catholick Church. pag.</hi> 32. he makes (and confeſſed he made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) <hi>the Ancient Creeds of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church the beſt meaſure of thoſe things which are believed to be neceſsary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> and conſequently were ſufficient to conſtitute the Eſſence, and Being of a True Church. Now 'tis evident, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ever queſtion it, but rather very often ſuppoſes it, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church doth embrace <hi>the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Creeds of the Catholick Church,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore even according to Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a true Church, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is neceſſarily ſuch. <hi>Pag.</hi> 26. he ſaies <hi>We have no Controverſie with them</hi> (Catholicks) <hi>about the Eſſential Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines of Religion, which is that we mean by their being a True Church.</hi> Finally, <hi>pag.</hi> 33. and in other places the Dr. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes between the Eſſence and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102636:53"/>Soundneſs of a Church, and he ſeveral times grants, that <hi>our Church holds all that is requiſite to the Eſſence of a True Church:</hi> But he denies, that ſhe holds all that is neceſſary to the <hi>Soundneſs</hi> of a Church: Neither did I ever alledge Dr. <hi>St.</hi> to the contrary; as above I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated.</p>
               <p>Hence is evidently concluded, that it is the unqueſtionable Sentiment of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, even as it is now in the world, is a True Church, retaining all the <hi>Eſſential,</hi> and <hi>Fundamental</hi> Points of Chriſtian Faith: All which I have ſayed, not becauſe Dr. <hi>St.</hi> did ever deny it; but becauſe ſome of his Friends could ſcarce believe that he, who had endeavoured with all his ſtrength, to prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> guilty of Idolatry, ſhould not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hold her to be a <hi>True Church.</hi> See more concerning this in his Anſwer to my Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 40, 41, 42. Wherefore ſince it cannot be queſtioned but that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has heretofore, and does ſtill allow theſe two Propoſitions, <hi>The Roman Church is a True Church, The Roman Church is an Idolatrous Church,</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:102636:54"/>we come now to examin, whether the latter Propoſition contradicts the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer? which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> denies; but we do prove in the following Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Roman</hi> Church holds any Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, or Eſſential Errour in matters of Faith, it is no True Church. For it is certain, that ſome Errours are ſufficient to unchurch a Community, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the very Being of a True Church: otherwiſe a Congregation that holds there is no God, might yet be a True Church: and if any Errours be ſuch, ſure ſuch are all Fundamental, and Eſſential Errours. For all Errours in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, even according to Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and other Proteſtant Divines are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Fundamental or Eſſential, and into Non-fundamental, or Non-eſſential. Theſe latter they affirm to be conſiſtent with the Eſſence, and Being of a True Church; but not with the Soundneſs thereof: But the former are deſtructive, not only to the Soundneſs, but alſo to very Eſſence of a True Church. So that whoever ſaies, that ſuch a Church is a True Church, but yot that ſhe holds ſome Fundamental-Errours, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102636:54"/>a manifeſt Contradiction, as if he ſhould ſay, ſuch a Church is, and is not True. Upon this account thoſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, who grant the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be a True Church, but yet depraved with ſeveral Errours, to ſave themſelves from Self-contradiction, commonly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that the Errours of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church are not Fundamental, nor Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, but only inferiour Errours, Non-fundamental, and Non-eſſential.</p>
               <p>Again, if the <hi>Roman</hi> Church holds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Errour, neceſſarily deſtructive to any Fundamental, or Eſſential Point of Faith, ſhe muſt needs hold a Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and Eſſential Errour in matters of Faith. This is alſo evident; neither can Dr. <hi>St.</hi> deny it. For an Errour is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated Fundamental, or Non-funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental; Eſſential, or Non-eſſential, from the nature and quality of the Truth, wherewith it is inconſiſtent: all Errour being inconſiſtent with ſome Truth. So that if the Truth, or any of the Truths, wherewith ſuch an Errour is inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, be Fundamental or Eſſential, the Errour muſt needs be Fundamental, or Eſſential: But if none of them be Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102636:55"/>neither can the Error be Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental. Now the inconſiſtency of a Propoſition with its contradictory, or of an Errour with the Truth oppoſite therunto, does not conſiſt, in that an Errour does abſolutely deſtroy the Truth in it ſelf, wherewith it is ſaid to be inconſiſtent: For it is certain this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Judgment, <hi>There is no God,</hi> does not deſtroy the Truth of its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory, <hi>There is a God:</hi> nor in that he, who gives an aſſent to the one part, cannot poſſibly at the ſame time give his aſſent to the contrary part; otherwiſe it would not be poſſible for any one to Contradict himſelf; which is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe, as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himſelf does too too well know. The forementioned incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency therefore conſiſts in the repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, in order to the Truth of both Propoſitions together, and at the ſame time; or in that the Truth of the one neceſſarily deſtroyes the Truth of the other: So that if the Errour, which is inconſiſtent with a Fundamental Truth, ſhould ceaſe to be an Errour, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Truth would ceaſe to be a Truth.</p>
               <p>Moreover ſome Errours are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102636:55"/>to any Fundamental Point, immediately, or formally, or in expreſs terms, as this Error, <hi>There is no God,</hi> is deſtructive to this Fundamental point, <hi>There is a God;</hi> but only mediately, and by Conſequences; becauſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy immediately ſomething, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſome Fundamental point is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily connexed; which being once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, ſuch a Fundamental point muſt neceſſarily fall: as, ſuppoſing that it is a Fundamental point of Chriſtian Faith, that <hi>Chriſt is God, Conſubſtantial to his Father,</hi> this Errour, <hi>Chriſt is a meer Creature,</hi> is beyond debate Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; although it does not deſtroy imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the former Truth, but only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and by Conſequence, becauſe it immediately deſtroyes its Contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, <hi>viz. Chriſt is not a meer Creature;</hi> which being deſtroyed, the former Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Truth does neceſſarily fall. For, whatſoever is God, either is <hi>no Creature,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>no meer Creature.</hi> Wherefore 'tis a Fundamental Errour, whatſoever neceſſarily deſtroyes a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Truth, whether mediately or immediately. For the malice and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102636:56"/>of a Fundamental Errour conſiſts in its Deſtructiveneſs to a Fundamental point: and what deſtroyes it mediately, does truly deſtroy it; but deſtroies with it ſome other thing. One may beat down a Steeple, either by ſhooting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately at the Steeple, or at the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that upholds the Steeple; and in both Caſes the Steeple is equally beaten down; but with this difference; that in the ſecond caſe the Tower alſo is beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en down with the Steeple. Yea, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himſelf <hi>pag.</hi> 24. confeſſes, the ſecond way of Worſhip, mentioned there by him, to be deſtructive mediately only, and by Conſequence, <hi>to the Exiſtency of a true God;</hi> and yet it is inconſiſtent, doubtleſs, with the <hi>Being of a true Church;</hi> ſince by ſuch a Worſhip, <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Godhead</hi> is denyed, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Falſe Gods are joyned with him in the ſame Worſhip; and to teach a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Gods, is beyond debate, to teach an Errour, by reaſon of its oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Godhead,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to <hi>the Being</hi> of a Church.</p>
               <p>Beſides, I ſaid, that an Errour, which is neceſſarily deſtructive to any
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102636:56"/>Fundamental point, whatſoever it be, muſt needs be Fundamental, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Eſſence of a True Church. For an Errour, as other Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is <hi>malignantis naturae,</hi> of a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant nature; ſuch as deſtroying any <hi>Eſſential</hi> part, or intrinſical condition, muſt needs deſtroy the whole. So that a Church, <hi>to be True,</hi> muſt have all her Eſſentials; but, to be abſolutely Falſe, 'tis enough, that any one of them be wanting, according to thoſe common Axioms of Philoſophers, <hi>Bonum ex in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegra cauſa; malum autem ex quolibet defectu.</hi> Death deſtroies the Eſſence of a man; and yet it neither deſtroies the Soul, nor the Body immediately; but only the Union between them both: which is the leaſt conſiderable thing in a mans Eſſence.</p>
               <p>Finally, becauſe we diſcourſe now, what Errours are Eſſential in matters of Faith, and inconſiſtent with the Being of a True Church, we muſt reflect, that according to Divines, there are two ſorts of Errours; the one Privative, the other Poſitive. A Church does err privatively againſt the Eſſence of a True Church,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102636:57"/>by not holding all the poſitive Eſſential points requiſite thereunto, (although ſhe ſhould not poſitively hold any thing contrary to ſuch points;) A Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Men, who ſhould not believe there is a God, although they ſhould not poſitively believe that there is no God, would beyond all queſtion, be no <hi>true Church.</hi> But a Church errs poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively againſt the Eſſence of a true Church, when ſhe poſitively holds, and aſſerts ſomething inconſiſtent with an Eſſential point, whatever elſe ſhe affirms. Doubtleſs a Church, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, which teaches <hi>that there is no God,</hi> cannot be a true Church, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe ſhe teaches. Both theſe ſorts of Errours are deſtructive to the Eſſence of a Church: and the latter is rather worſe than the former. For it is worſe <hi>to believe that there is no God,</hi> than <hi>not to believe that there is a God.</hi> Hence I infer, that to the conſtitution of a true Church 'tis not enough to aſſert, the poſitive Articles requiſite to the Being of a Church; but 'tis alſo neceſſary, not to hold any Errour, inco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102636:57"/>perſons, who deny, either medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately or immediately, thoſe very points which they confeſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being premiſed, I go on to ſhew, that if the <hi>Roman</hi> Church does hold any kind of Idolatry, (what kind ſoever it be) to be lawful, as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> expreſsly affirms ſhe does, ſhe muſt needs hold an Errour deſtructive a to Fundamental, and Eſſential point of Faith; and by conſequence, a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Errour, inconſiſtent with the Eſſence of a true Church. And ſince 'tis certain, that no kind of Idolatry is lawful, if the <hi>Roman</hi> Church holds any kind of Idolatry as lawful, ſhe muſt needs hold an Errour inconſiſtent with ſome Truth, as all Errour is. Now it is not poſſible, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſhould hold any ſort of Idolatry what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, as lawful, unleſs ſhe holds that <hi>ſome Honour, which is due only to God, may be given to a meer Creature.</hi> For the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Idolatry in general does neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily contain this, even as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſes, in this Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 24. where he ſaies thus, <hi>I agree in general, that the true notion of Idolatry is, giving
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102636:58"/>the Honour due only to God, to a meer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> but he adds preſently theſe words, <hi>I deſire no greater advantage againſt the Church of Rome, in order to prove her Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, than from ſuch a Conceſſion:</hi> which is as much as if I ſhould ſay, <hi>I deſire no greater advantage againſt Dr.</hi> St. <hi>in order to prove him a Knave, than that he ſhould grant, as doubtleſs he does, that the Notion of a Knave in general, is he, who makes it his buſineſs to cheat others:</hi> For I am certain, that it is far eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſhew, that this notion of a Knave does agree to Dr. <hi>St.</hi> than that notion of Idolatry to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>But for my preſent purpoſe it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that Dr <hi>St.</hi> grants that to be the true notion of Idolatry in general. For ſo 'tis evident, that let the kinds of Idolatry be never ſo many, they muſt needs participate the forementioned no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becauſe all the Species, or different kinds, muſt needs participate the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral notion, under which they are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: as for inſtance, becauſe it is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral notion of an Animal, to be <hi>vivens ſenſibile,</hi> a living Subſtance endowed with a ſenſitive power, let the Species,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102636:58"/>or differences be never ſo many, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that there ſhould be any ſort of Animal, which is not <hi>vivens ſenſibile.</hi> So that, whatſoever is not <hi>vivens ſenſible,</hi> is not <hi>Animal:</hi> and whatſoever Worſhip is ſuch, that thereby <hi>the Honour due only to God, is not given to a meer Creature,</hi> ſuch a worſhip cannot be any ſort of Idolatry.</p>
               <p>Hence I infer, that 'tis impoſſible the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſhould teach, or hold, any kind of Idolatry what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it be, <hi>groſs,</hi> or <hi>not groſs,</hi> but ſhe muſt hold, (ſuppoſing the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Idolatry in general, to be ſuch as has been inſinuated) expreſsly or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly, in the ſame manner as ſhe holds Idolatry, <hi>That ſome Honour due only to God may be given to a meer Creature:</hi> which Errour (for evidently 'tis an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour) is inconſiſtent with the contrary Truth, <hi>viz. No Honour due to God may be given to a meer Creature.</hi> And what Truth is this? Fundamental and Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, or Non-fundamental and Non-eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial? without debate it is a Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and Eſſential point of Religion. For what point is ſuch, if this be not? Nay Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himſelf does abſolutely grant it, <hi>pag.</hi> 26. in the Anſwer to my firſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102636:59"/>as hereafter will appear; and <hi>p.</hi> 21. he accounts among the Eſſentials of a true Church, and the Fundamental Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, this very propoſition, <hi>viz. That God, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, are the proper object of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip;</hi> or (which is the ſame) <hi>no Divine Worſhip,</hi> or <hi>no Honour due only to God, is to be given to any one but God.</hi> Since therefore all Idolatry is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the forementioned Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, and Eſſential point, 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot hold any kind of Idolatry whatſoever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holding a Fundamental Errour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the very Eſſence, and Being of a True Church. Wherefore Dr. <hi>St.</hi> by granting the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be a True Church, and yet charging her with Idolatry, does commit a palpable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and in one breath blows cold and hot; aſſerting, that ſhe is a True Church, and yet that ſhe holds ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inconſiſtent with the very Being and Eſſence of a True Church.</p>
               <p>To draw this Argument into a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower circle, I form this <hi>Dilemma.</hi> Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Idolatry Dr. <hi>St.</hi> Fathers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Church, <hi>Some Honour, due only
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102636:59"/>to God, is given to a meer Creature, or not.</hi> If <hi>not,</hi> then it is no Idolatry, as not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiparing the general Notion of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: If <hi>ſo,</hi> then it is deſtrrctive to an Eſſential point of Religion; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the Eſſence of a True Church. So that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> by diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two ſorts of Idolatry, one deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive to the Being of a Church, another not-deſtructive to the Being of a Church, does as much as tell us, There are two ſorts of Idolatry; one, that <hi>is Idolatry,</hi> another, that is <hi>not Idolatry:</hi> of the former he declares us free; but of the latter, he makes us guilty. And we, poor Souls! becauſe we cannot diſcern ſuch ſubtle diſtinctions as theſe, muſt be chalked up for Half-witted men. But if the accompliſhedneſs of Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s wit has no more of wit in it, then No Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry has of Idolatry, we have little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to envy him.</p>
               <p>Yet farther; 'tis impoſſible, that a Church, which holds any damnable Errour, ſhould be a True Church. For all damnable Errours lead to Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and upon that account are called Damnable. But a True Church carries to Salvation; and therefore muſt be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102636:60"/>True in all things neceſſary to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining thereof. Nor among thoſe things which are neceſſary to the obtaining taining of Salvation, one is the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Damnable Errours, as being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive thereunto. Whence it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that a Church, which holds any Damnable Errour, cannot ſo long be a True Church: and to hold any Idolatry whatſoever is, without queſtion, a Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Errour; ſince all Idolatry is Damnable, and deſtructive to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yea Dr. St. <hi>pag.</hi> 34. Charges our Church with Damnable Errours; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon the account of the Idolatry, which, as he fancies, ſhe does teach; and which page 22. he owns to be very ſinful: neither do I believe, that the <hi>Dr.</hi> will dare to affirm, that a Church, which ſhould teach <hi>Adultery to be Lawful,</hi> could ſo long be a True Church: and yet Idolatry is no leſs damnable, and deſtructive to Salvation than <hi>Adultery.</hi> Wherefore to hold ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them as Lawful, is equally at leaſt deſtructive to the Being of a True Church. 'Tis therefore impoſſible, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſhould hold any ſort of Idolatry, as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will needs have
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102636:60"/>us believe ſhe does, without holding a Damnable, and Fundamental Errour, deſtructive to the very Eſſence, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a True Church.</p>
               <p>For in the Dictionary of ſuch, as have any inſight into Religious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; a Fundamental Errour in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, a Damnable Errour, and an Errour inconſiſtent with the Eſſence of a True Church, are Terms Synonymous.</p>
               <p>Moreover, whereas the very Vitals of a Religion are the <hi>Honour of God</hi> and the <hi>Salvation of Souls,</hi> Idolatry under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines them both; by giving the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due only unto God,</hi> to a meer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by <hi>leading ſouls to Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> How therefore can it chuſe, but deſtroy the very Eſſence of a True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? And as a High Treaſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one does give the Honour, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect due only to his Sovereign, to a meer Subject, is beyond debate contrary to a Fundamental point of Loyalty, and deſtructive thereunto; ſo it is a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Contradiction to aſſert, that ſuch a perſon is a <hi>true and faithful Subject,</hi> but yet a <hi>Traitour:</hi> in the like manner, ſince by all Idolatry, according to the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102636:61"/>Notion thereof aſſented unto even by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is given to a meer Creature <hi>the Honour due only unto God,</hi> and upon this account <hi>Idolatry is High Treaſon againſt God,</hi> Dr. <hi>St.</hi> muſt needs be guilty of <hi>Self contradiction,</hi> in affirming the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church to be a <hi>True Church,</hi> but yet <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> Whence appears, that the inſtance of a <hi>Traitour,</hi> alledged by the Dr. <hi>page</hi> 25. makes rather againſt him, than for him, where we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that according to Dr. <hi>St.</hi> not only the practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but alſo her Doctrine is Idolatrous: ſince ſhe teaches and approves of that very practice, which ſhe judges to be Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we have ſhewn, that all ſorts of Idolatry are inconſiſtent with the very Eſſence of a True Church, and by conſequence, that it is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Contradiction to affirm, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is a <hi>True</hi> Church, and yet depraved with Idolatry. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, 'tis enough for my purpoſe to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, that <hi>that ſort</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> Fathers upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, Deſtroies the very Eſſence,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102636:61"/>and Being of a True Church: which I ſhall prove in the following Chapter,</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Another Proof of the ſame intent, drawn from the Nature of the Idolatry, the Doctour Fathers upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</head>
               <p>THe Idolatry Dr. <hi>St.</hi> endeavours to faſten upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is, as he pretends to prove at large in his Diſcourſe concerning the Idolatry practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome; pag.</hi> 58. <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi> point blanck againſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commanded (according to their reckoning) of the Decalogue; and is immediately oppoſite thereunto. Now 'tis certain, that this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contains an Eſſential, and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental point of Religion, ſince it ſo neerly concerns Gods Honour, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the chief aim of Religion. Whence it manifeſtly follows, that the Idolatry he Fathers upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102636:62"/>deſtructive to a Fundamental point of Religion, and by conſequence inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the very Being of a True Church.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Dr. does willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, (and it would be a madneſs not to do ſo) that there is ſome ſort of Idolatry deſtructive not only to the Soundeſs, (for this is general to all ſorts of Idolatry) but alſo to the very Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and Being of a True Church. See his Anſwer <hi>pag.</hi> 24. whence we infer, that whatever Church holds that kind of Idolatry, which is deſtructive to the Being of a Church, cannot ſo long be a True Church whatever other Tenets ſhe maintains. So that it would have been a palpable Contradiction in Dr. <hi>St.</hi> even according to his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, had he held the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a True Church (as he does) and yet charged her with the Forementioned kind of Idolatry. Now let us examin, what Character Dr. <hi>St.</hi> gives us of the Idolatry he is pleaſed to Father upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>In his Diſcourſe concerning the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102636:62"/>pag.</hi> 69. he ſaies thus: <hi>It ſeems much more reaſonable for me to worſhip God by Proſtrating my ſelf to the Sun, or any of the Heavenly Bodies, nay to an Ant, or a Flie, than to a Picture or Image;</hi> and he endeavours to prove this his Aſſertion: according to which the Idolatry he Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, in the Veneration of the Pictures, or Images of God, is eſteemed by him far worſe than the Adoration of the Sun, Moon, an Ant, or a Flie, practiſed by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. <hi>pag.</hi> 132. he approves this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of <hi>Coſterus: If the Doctrine of Tranſubstantiation be not true, the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of the Heathens in Worſhipping ſome Golden, or Silver Statue, or any Images of their gods; or the Laplanders in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping a red Cloath, or the Aegyptians an Animal, is more excuſable, than of Christians, that Worſhip a bit of Bread.</hi> This <hi>Coſterus</hi> aſfirms, only upon this condition, That the Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation be not true: But Dr. <hi>St.</hi> who abſolutely judges that Doctrine not to be true, and moreover approves the foreſaid Teſtimony of <hi>Coſterus,</hi> muſt needs hold the Idolatry he imputes to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102636:63"/>Catholicks in the Adoration of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, to be more deteſtable, than that of the Aegyptians and Laplanders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. 134.</hi> he ſeems to approve this Sentiment of Dr. <hi>Taylour, An Image then becomes an Idol when Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is given to it: and to Worſhip Falſe Gods or to give Divine Honor to an Image, which is no God, is all one kind of formal I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry</hi> Wherefore Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſince he aſſents to this Doctrine, Parallels the Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Images, practiſed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to the Worſhip of Falſe Gods, and looks upon them both as one kind of formal Idolatry: and certainly the Worſhip of Falſe Gods, as rejecting the true God, is inconſiſtent with the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a True Church. For what Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is ſo, if this be not? In the ſame <hi>pag.</hi> he pretends to ſhew, that the <hi>groſſeſt Idolatry in the world, is excuſable on the ſame grounds,</hi> whereon we excuſe from Idolatry the Veneration of Chriſt in the Euchariſt: which he compares with the Idolatry of thoſe, who ſaid <hi>Chriſt was the Sun:</hi> and he adds, <hi>pag.</hi> 136. <hi>That the Abſurdities of Tranſubſtantiation are greater, than of that Doctrine; which
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102636:63"/>teaches the Sun to be God;</hi> and in the ſame place he calls it as Venial a Fault; The Worſhipping that for the True God, which is not ſo; ſuch is the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry he Fathers upon us, and terms it the Superſtition of an undue way of Worſhiping; as the Worſhipping Falſe Gods, which he ſtiles the Superſtitian of an undue object: and <hi>pag.</hi> 137. he ſaies thus, <hi>The moſt ſtupid and ſenſeleſs of all Idolaters, who Worſhip the very Images for God,</hi> (which the wiſer among the Heathens, according to his Judgment, alwayes diſalowed) <hi>were in truth the moſt excuſable upon this ground;</hi> upon which we excuſe from Idolatry the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration we give to the Sacrament of the Altar: and by conſequence, the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry he Fathers upon us in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is in his opinion worſe, and leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, than the moſt ſtupid, and ſenſeleſs Idolatry of the Heathens.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>page</hi> immediately before, he compares our Veneration of Chriſt in the Euchariſt, <hi>with the Aegyptians wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the Sun for God,</hi> and the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites the Golden Calf, believing it was the true God.</hi> Pag. 142, 143. ſpeaking of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102636:64"/>the Veneration the <hi>Roman</hi> Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to Saints, he adds, <hi>I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly underſtand, why I may not as well honour God by giving Worſhip to the Sun, as to</hi> Ignatius Loyola, <hi>or St.</hi> Francis, <hi>or any other of the late Cannonized Saints?</hi> And why does he not ſpeak of the B. Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> of the Apoſtles, of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and of other Ancient Saints, ſince he equally impugns the Veneration of all Saints? The reaſon he adds is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent: <hi>I am ſure,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>the Sun is a certain Monument of Gods goodneſs, and I cannot be miſtaken therein. But I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be certain of the holineſs of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, viz.</hi> the late Cannonized Saints. — <hi>For all that I can know,</hi> Ignatius Loyola <hi>was a great Hypocrite. But I am ſure that the Sun is none. — I know the best of men have their Corruptions, and to what degree it is impoſſible for others to underſtand. But I am certain the ſpots of the Sun are no Moral Impurities, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to God.</hi> How frivolous this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, will clearly appear by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will not deny, but that ſome Reverence, Reſpect, Eſteem, and Veneration may be given in this life to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102636:64"/>men, by reaſon of their Holineſs, Sanctity, and Honeſty of Life; and that one may here upon earth implore the Prayers of other men, eſpecially Holy and Honeſt Men; or invoke them to be his Interceſſours with God in his Neceſſities; which is practiſed by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; and no more than this we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the Saints in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Now according to this Reaſon of the Dr. (to uſe his own words) <hi>Why may I not as well honour Dr.</hi> St.<hi>'s Cat, or Dog, (who in the common opinion of Philoſophers, as being Subſtances endowed with Life, are perfecter than the Sun) as Dr.</hi> St. <hi>himſelf; or invoke them as well as him, or any of the Proteſtant Biſhops, or Miniſters? I am ſure Dr.</hi> St.<hi>'s Cat, and Dog, do whatever God will have them do; and that they never have tranſgreſs'd any of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and I cannot be miſtaken therein. But I can never be certain, that Dr.</hi> St. <hi>is an honeſt man; yea I am certain, that he has tranſgreſs'd Gods Commandments. For all that I can know Dr.</hi> St. <hi>is a great Hypocrite, and an errant Knave. But I am ſure Dr.</hi> St.<hi>'s Cat, and Dog are none. I know that Dr.</hi> St. <hi>has his Corruptions,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102636:65"/>ſince the best of men have theirs; and to what degree he has them, is impoſſible for me, or others, to underſtand; but I am certain, that the Blemiſhes of thoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſuppoſing they have them, are no Moral Impurities, nor diſpleaſing to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence it follows, that according to this Argument of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> 'tis as Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and more laudable, to Reverence, upon the account of Honeſty, Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s Cat, or Dog, &amp; to invoke their Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; as to Reverence Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himſelf, or to invoke his aſſiſtance by Prayers: and what ever anſwer Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſhall give to this Inſtance, will ſolve the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he makes againſt us. For 'tis certain that the Sun is as uncapable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, or to be made to underſtand, our addreſſes, or to intercede for us, or to lead a moral, honeſt life, as a Cat, or a Dog: But Dr. <hi>St.</hi> knows too well, that it is not for his intereſt to conſider the incoherency of his Principles, or the train of Abſurdities, which commonly wait upon his Arguments. Yet for our preſent intent it is enough, to ſhew, that the Idolatry he endeavours to faſten upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, in the Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102636:65"/>of Saints, which ſhe allows of, is, in his perſwaſion, as bad or worſe, than the Adoration of the Sun.</p>
               <p>Page 159. he makes a large Parallel between the Veneration, that <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks afford to Saints, and the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of the Heathens, in Sacrificing to their Inferiour Deities, or Heroes. <hi>Did the Iſraelites,</hi> ſaies he <hi>uſe ſolemn Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of making any capable of Divine Worship? So does the</hi> Roman <hi>Church. Did they ſet up their Images in publick pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Worſhip, and then kneel down before them, and Invocate thoſe repreſented by them? So does the</hi> Roman <hi>Church. Did they Conſecrate Temples, and Erect Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars to them, and keep Feſtivals and burn Incenſe before them? So does the</hi> Roman <hi>Church. Laſtly, Did they offer up Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in thoſe Temples to the Honour of their leſſer Deities, or Heroes? So does the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Church.</hi> Whence it appears, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> does hold us for as great Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by reaſon of the Honour we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to Saints, as the Heathens were in Adoring their leſſer Deities. All this Doctrine he had laid down in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Queſtions, <hi>pag.</hi> 3, 4. where
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102636:66"/>he has theſe words. <hi>The ſame Argument whereby the Papiſts make the Worſhip of the Bread in the Euchariſt not to be Idolatry, would make the groſſeſt Heatheniſh Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try not to be ſo:</hi> And a little after he ſaies thus; <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>in the Worſhip of God by Images, the Adoration of the Bread in the Eucharist, and the formal Invocation of Saints, doth require the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the Creature, the Worſhip due only to the Creator.</hi> Whence it follows, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> does Charge the <hi>Roman</hi> Church with an Idolatry of an undue Object; Becauſe the Worſhip, due only to God, is given by us (as he fancies) to a meer Creature: and not only with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of an undue, and prohibited man-manner of Worſhip: which are two ſorts of Idolatry he makes mention of.</p>
               <p>In the ſame page, to confirm the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Doctrine, he ſaies thus; <hi>In the Worſhip of God by Images,</hi> wherewith he Charges us, <hi>the Worſhip due to God</hi> (and I ſuppoſe he ſpeaks of a Worſhip due only to God) <hi>is terminated wholly on the Creature.</hi> Wherefore if this be Idolatry, it muſt be Idolatry of <hi>an undue Object.</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:102636:66"/>Much more to the ſame purpoſe might be alledged out of him. But what alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy I have produced, is ſufficient.</p>
               <p>From what hitherto has been quoted out of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> 'tis manifeſt, that the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry he Fathers upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is, in his opinion as bad, nay worſe, than the groſſeſt Idolatry of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. Now ſince the groſſeſt Idolatry of the Heathens is, beyond debate (and Dr. <hi>St.</hi> alwaies ſuppoſes it is ſo) is (I ſay) inconſiſtent with the Being, and Eſſence of a True Church, and a true Religion: and ſince the Malice of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry is to be ſcaned by the oppoſition it has with Religion; this being ſo, is it not a madneſs to ſay, and confeſs, that the groſſeſt Idolatry of the Heathens is inconſiſtent, not only with the Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but alſo with the Eſſence of a true Church; but yet that the Idolatry of the Papiſts, although as bad, nay worſe; than the groſſeſt of the Heathens, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent only with the Soundneſs of a Church, and not with the Eſſence. Is not this, as if one ſhould ſay, <hi>If you cut off the head of a man, you will kill him; but if you give him another wound as bad,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102636:67"/>or worſe; if you run him through the heart, if you cut him all in pieces, you will only make him ſick?</hi> What ſence can there be in affirming, that the Heathens are not members of the True Church, becauſe they are Idolaters in ſo high a degree; and yet that <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, though groſſer Idolaters than the Heathens, are Members of the True Church? That the Heatheniſh Idolatry, at leaſt ſome, is of a nature high enough to unchurch Heathens; and yet that the <hi>Roman</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, though groſſer and higher than any Heatheniſh, is not of a nature high enough (as he ſaies <hi>pag.</hi> 22.) to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church <hi>Romaniſts?</hi> If this be not <hi>Non-ſenſe,</hi> what is?</p>
               <p>Moreover, from what we have alledg'd out of the Dr. 'tis evident, that he aſcrib's unto us Idolatry of an undue Object: and ſure all ſuch Idolatry is inconſiſtent with the very Being of a True Church. For Dr. <hi>St.</hi> when he would excuſe the Idolatry he Fathers upon us, from being deſtructive to the very Eſſence of a true Church, he endeavours to ſay, that it is only Idolatry of an undue manner of Worſhip; which ſhews, that he holds
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102636:67"/>Idolatry of an undue Object, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the Eſſence of a Church. Since therefore he confeſſes, in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces above mentioned, that the Idolatry of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is Idolatry of an undue Object, he makes her guilty of an Idolatry, inconſiſtent with the Eſſence of a true Church.</p>
               <p>Again, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſeems to ſuppoſe, that an Idolatry, which brings in a multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Gods, is deſtructive to the Eſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a Church: and why? Becauſe it is deſtructive, at leaſt by conſequence, and mediately, to a Fundamental point of Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. Since therefore the Idolatry he fathers upon us, is deſtructive, at leaſt mediately, to this Fundamental point, <hi>The Honour due only to God is not to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a meer Creature,</hi> aſſented unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Pagans, it muſt be inconſiſtent with the Being of a Church. For an Errour deſtructive to any Fundamental point of Religion whatever, is deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive to the Being of a Church, as has been demonſtrated. Yea an Idolatry accompanied with the acknowledgment of one onely God, (ſuch is the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102636:68"/>he imputes to us) may, doubtleſs, be inconſiſtent with the Being of a Church: as for inſtance, the Idolatry of ſuch, who accknowledging one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, ſhould adore no other God but the Sun.</p>
               <p>Yet farther, the Adoration of a red Cloth, which the Laplanders uſe, either is deſtructive to the Being of a Church, or not. Sure Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is not ſo mad as to ſay it is not. Now if it be deſtructive to the Eſſence of a Church, as certainly it is, is not Dr. <hi>St.</hi> aſhamed to ſay, that the Adoration of Chriſt in the Euchariſt is worſe, and leſs excuſable, than that of the Laplanders, and yet that it may be conſiſtent with the Being of a True Church? Can any one require a more convincing Argument, to prove, that ſuch a Church is no true Church; then if he can ſhew, that ſhe adores, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the Adoration of a red Cloth for God, or ſomething as bad, or worſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> affirms, that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church does not only teach an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry as bad or worſe, than the groſſeſt of the Heathens, but alſo that ſhe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es it as an Article of Divine Faith, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102636:68"/>it upon God, and making him the Author thereof. For the <hi>Roman</hi> Church delivers as Articles of Divine Faith, the Adoration of Chriſt in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, the Invocation of Saints, and the Veneration of Images, as both he and we confeſs. The Dr. moreover maintaines all the forementioned pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ices, and Doctrines to be flar Idolatry; as much, or more deteſtable, than the groſſeſt Heatheniſh Idolatry. Now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly 'tis a Fundamental, and Eſſential point of Religion, <hi>That God is not the Author of any Superſtition whatſoever,</hi> much leſs of ſo groſs an Idolatry, as he will needs have the <hi>Roman</hi> Idolatry to be: and conſequently, 'tis impoſſible, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſhould teach God to be the Author of ſuch an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, (as neceſſarily ſhe muſt, if ſhe teaches it as an Article of Faith) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out erring againſt the aforeſaid Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental point; and by conſequence, without incurring a Fundamental Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, deſtructive to the very Being of a Church.</p>
               <p>'Tis manifeſt therefore, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> does commit a palpable Contradiction,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102636:69"/>by aſſerting the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be a True Church, and yet charging her with an Idolatry as bad, or worſe, than the groſſeſt of the Heathens. I know not whether theſe lines will fetch blood from Dr. <hi>St.</hi> for (as he ſaies, <hi>Pref. Gen.</hi> he was threatned with ſuch lines from his Adverſaries) But I am ſure, that if he has any blood in him, and has not loſt all ſenſe of his honour, they will fetch the blood into his face, and make him bluſh.</p>
               <p>After the Dr. had proved unſucceſsful in ſhewing my way of proceeding diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous, he endeavours to prove it <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtical,</hi> and <hi>captious,</hi> ſaying, <hi>pag.</hi> 23. <hi>That the starting of a new Objection, or the raiſing a new Difficulty anſwers no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument;</hi> and that this manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of mine, <hi>is a clear evidence of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtical, and cavilling humour, rather than of any intention to ſatisfie an inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive mind.</hi> To this I anſwer, When the Diſciples of the Phariſees, and Officers of <hi>Herod</hi> came to tempt our Saviour, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 22.) they propoſed unto him a queſtion, and our Saviour ſtarting a new queſtion, and raiſing a new Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:102636:69"/>ſolved the queſtion propoſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and ſilenced his Adverſaries. But had Dr. <hi>St.</hi> been with the Enemies of Chriſt in that occaſion, he would have ſuggeſted unto them, <hi>That it was a clear evidence of a ſophiſtical, and cavel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling humour,</hi> in order to anſwer one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, to ſtart another. Beſides, what queſtion, or difficulty do I ſtart? I take for granted, that <hi>the Roman Church is a true Church,</hi> as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has heretofore, and does ſtill grant: and hence I prove the nullity of the Charge he laies againſt us: which is the common way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing an Adverſary; <hi>viz. Out of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples granted by him, to infer the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory of what he maintains.</hi> But Dr. <hi>St.</hi> had charged me with <hi>Sophiſtry,</hi> and <hi>Captiouſneſs;</hi> and he muſt make it good the beſt way he can: which is to feign his Adverſary to ſay what he does not.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> The Invalidity of the Doctor's Anſwers to our Propoſitions in Particular.</head>
               <p>LEt us ſee now, for the greater ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Reader, what he Anſwers to every particular Propoſition I laid down in order, to prove him guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Self contradiction, in Charging us with Idolatry; and to clear our Church from ſo foul an Aſperſion: my firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis an Article of Faith, and a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental point of Religion, That the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which is due only to God, is not to be given to a meer Creature.</hi> This Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Dr. abſolutely grants, without any diſtinction, ſaying, <hi>pag.</hi> 26. <hi>His firſt Propoſition I agree to.</hi> He adds after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>That there is no diſpute between us whether that Honour, which is due on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God, may be given to a Creature;</hi> and finally, he grants this Propoſition <hi>to be in it ſelf true.</hi> But after he had abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely granted it, without any diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102636:70"/>he begins to quibble at it. But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire he would tell me, whether the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception he afterwards makes againſt it, does hinder, or not, the abſolute truth thereof? If it does not, what more can I, or any one elſe deſire, when we lay down Principles, or Propoſitions, than that the Propoſition we advance be abſolutely true? If it does hinder the abſolute truth of the aforeſaid Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, why did he grant it abſolutely without any diſtinction? But what is the exception he makes againſt us in this Propoſition? He ſaies, <hi>We ſhould have diſcuſt, what that Honour is, which is due only to God.</hi> Wherein he adds, <hi>there is a great diſpute between them and us.</hi> So that it ſeems, he would have had us lay down, among the Principles, which we advanced againſt him, ſome thing that is diſputed between us: which is point blank againſt the very notion of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; which ought to he agreed unto by all, or at leaſt by the Adverſary, with whom we deal. So that he accuſes us, that we proceed Sophiſtically, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly: and why? Becauſe (forſooth) we do not lay down for a Principle, that
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102636:71"/>which is not a Principle: which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is a frivolous accuſation. Neither was there any need, we ſhould diſcuſs in particular, <hi>what that Honour is which is due only to God.</hi> For, the Honour we give to Images, or Saints, either is <hi>due only to God, or not.</hi> If the Dr. ſaies it is; then it is a palpable Contradiction, for the Dr. to affirm that our Church is True, and yet that ſhe allows Saints and Images ſuch an Honour. If he ſaies it is not, then how can he accuſe our Church of Idolatry, becauſe ſhe gives to Saints and Images ſuch an Honour? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without deſcending to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Honour due only to God, we prove, that either Dr. <hi>St.</hi> muſt confeſs, that our Church is free from the aforeſaid Idolatray, or that he contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; which was my proper task in that place: and is not this enough?</p>
               <p>He adds, <hi>pag.</hi> 27. <hi>That it cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us from Idolatry,</hi> to ſay, <hi>That we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it to be Idolatry, to give that Honour, which we ſuppoſe to be due only to God, to a meer Creature,</hi> in caſe that he can prove, that we give <hi>to meer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures any part of that Honour which is due
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:102636:71"/>to God.</hi> I do confeſs, that were it once proved, that we give any Honour, duly only to God to a meer Creature, ſuch an acknowledgment would not excuſe us from Idolatry; as it did not excuſe the Heathens from the like Crime, although they acknowledged the ſame Truth. But here we muſt reflect, That ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Dr. ſaies, that 'tis Idolatry to give to a meer Creature, <hi>the Honour due only to God:</hi> and in that he ſaies the truth: Othertimes, as in this place, he omits only, and ſpeaks of <hi>Honour due to God.</hi> For ſome honour is due to God; but not only to God. As when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was upon earth, without doubt the Honour of kneeling down before him, was due unto him: which Honour notwithſtanding is due unto a King, and to ones Father. But what is all this, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſets down in this Paragraph, to clear himſelf from Self-contradiction, in aſſerting our Church to be a true Church, and yet charging her with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry? which was the deſign in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of his Anſwer; and my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate intention, in <hi>Dr. Stillingfleet againſt Dr. Stillingfleet,</hi> was to prove
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102636:72"/>him guilty of Self-contradiction, as he ſaies, <hi>page</hi> 28. <hi>His immediate intention was not to clear their Church from Idolatry, but to accuſe me of Contradiction:</hi> yet I have ſhewn above, that if I evince that he contradicts himſelf <hi>in the way I inſiſt upon</hi> I do manifeſtly clear our Church from Idolatry; and that this part was of my deſign.</p>
               <p>My <hi>2d</hi> Propoſition was, as follows. <hi>To teach Idolatry, is to err againſt the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Article of Faith, &amp; Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal point of Religion,</hi> i.e. (as he ſaies) to teach Idolatry, is to teach <hi>That the Honour which is due only to God, is to be given</hi> (I ſayed <hi>may be given</hi>) <hi>to a meer Creature.</hi> To this ſecond Propoſition he Anſwers thus, <hi>pag.</hi> 27. That <hi>this is to teach Idolatry, no one queſtions:</hi> but he adds, <hi>that they who do not teach this,</hi> i. e. that the Honour which is due only to God, may be given to a meer Creature; <hi>may yet teach Idolatry:</hi> and therefore he ſaies, <hi>We ſhould, if we had proceeded as we ought to have done, have laid down an univerſal Negative,</hi> viz. <hi>No Church, that does not teach this, can be guilty of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and not a particular Affirmative,</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:102636:72"/>as he fancies this Propoſition of mine to be, <hi>To teach Idolatry, is to teach, that the Honour due only to God may be given to a meer Creature.</hi> Hence we may diſcover, how great a Logician Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how he ſhould fancy that Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mine to be a particular Affirmative; and not an Univerſal. Is this Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a particular Affirmative, <hi>To be a man</hi> is to be <hi>Animal rationale?</hi> Sure no body that underſtands any thing of Rationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, can take ſuch a Propoſition for a particular Affirmative: and as the true Notion of a man in general is <hi>Animal rationale;</hi> ſo the true notion of Idolatry, according to Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himſelf, <hi>pag.</hi> 24. quoted above, is, <hi>giving the Honour due only to God, to a meer Creature.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe two Propoſitions are univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Affirmatives, equivalent to theſe, <hi>To be any man whatſoever, is to be Animal ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionale; To teach any Idolatry whatſoever, is to teach, that the Honour due only to God, may be given to a meer Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon hereof is, becauſe, as Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians tell us, an indefinite Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a neceſſary matter, (ſuch is the Notion of a Thing; which muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102636:73"/>agree unto it) is equivalent to an Univerſal; as to ſay a man is <hi>Animal rationale,</hi> is as much as to ſay, <hi>every man is ſuch;</hi> and to ſay, Idolatry is <hi>the giving to a meer creature the honour due only to God,</hi> (which is the true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Idolatry in general) is the ſame, as if one ſhould ſay <hi>All Idolatry is ſuch.</hi> Now if this Univerſal Affirmative be true, as it is, even according to Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s confeſſion, a Church that teaches any ſort of Idolatry whatſoever, does teach, that <hi>the Honour which is due only to God, may be given to a meer Creature:</hi> and hence it neceſſarily follows, That no Church, that does not teach this, can be guilty of any ſort of Idolatry; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every man is <hi>animal rationale</hi> (a rational Animal) it muſt needs follow, that nothing, that is not <hi>animal rationale,</hi> can be a man; whoever has the leaſt ſmattering of Logick, cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of theſe Rules. But it was not for Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s purpoſe to remember any thing of Logick, or of Rationality. Whence I conclude, that the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on layed down by me is an Univerſal Affirmative, equivalent to the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſet down by the Dr. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102636:73"/>no Church can teach any Idolatry, without teaching, that <hi>the Honour which is due only to God, may be given to a meer Creature,</hi> it is evidently inferred, that no Church can teach any Idolatry, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out erring againſt the forementioned <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> and <hi>Fundamental point of Religion:</hi> which is all I pretended in my ſecond Propoſition.</p>
               <p>Beſides, although I ſhould grant, (as I do not) that a Church might teach ſome ſort of Idolatry, without teaching, or requiring, that <hi>the Honour due only to God, be given to a meer Creature;</hi> yet, according to Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s own confeſſion, the Idolatry he Fathers upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is ſuch, that it requires the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which is due only to God, to be given to a meer Creature. For in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe concerning the <hi>Roman</hi> Idolatry, <hi>pag.</hi> 3. he has theſe words, <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>in the Worſhip of God by Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the Adoration of the Bread in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, and the formal Invocation of Saints, doth require giving to the Creature Worſhip due only to the Creator.</hi> So that according to this Aſſertion of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> which he endeavours to eſtabliſh
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:102636:74"/>throughout that whole Diſcourſe, no Church can teach the Idolatry he fathers upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, without teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>giving to a meer Creature, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor &amp; Worſhip due only to the Creator:</hi> and conſequently without erring againſt that Article of Faith, and Fundamental point of Religion, contained in my firſt Propoſition: which is enough for my main intent. So that, if my ſecond Propoſition be propounded thus, <hi>To teach that ſort of Idolatry, which</hi> Dr. <hi>St.</hi> Fathers upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is to err againſt the forementioned Article of Faith, and Fundamental point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, he will have nothing to quibble at it; ſince he expreſsly aſſerts, that ſuch a kind of Idolatry requires the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that Article. whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that this ſecond Propoſition is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo agreed unto by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> either abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, or at leaſt as far, as is neceſſary for my purpoſe.</p>
               <p>My third Propoſition runs thus: <hi>A Church that does not err againſt any Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Faith, nor againſt any Fundamental point of Religion, does not teach Idolatry.</hi> To this Propoſition he anſwers, That <hi>it
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102636:74"/>is very Sophiſtical and Captious.</hi> Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſeems to be poſſeſs'd with ſuch a panick fear to be Non-pluſs'd by me, that had I ſaid <hi>two and two are four,</hi> in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood he would have called it a <hi>Sophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Captious Propoſition.</hi> And this is a common flaw in weak, but obſtinate defendants; who, when they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay againſt a Propoſition, they Characteriſe it for Sophiſtical. But let us ſee in what conſiſts the Sophiſtry, and Captiouſneſs of this Propoſition. He ſaies, <hi>pag.</hi> 28, 29. <hi>That if by Article of Faith, and Fundamental point of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he means the main Fundamental points of Doctrine contained in the Apoſtles Creed, then a Church, which does own all the Fundamentals of Doctrine, may be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Idolatry, and teach thoſe things, wherein it lies.</hi> But where is Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s ingenuity? My Propoſition was not That a Church which owns all Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, does not teach Idolatry; but that a Church which does not err againſt any Fundamental, does not teach Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: which is very different; becauſe a Church may err againſt a Doctrine which ſhe owns, and contradict her ſelf,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:102636:75"/>as has been hinted at above, and Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himſelf agrees unto, as hereafter will appear, So that the Dr. does not deny my Propoſition; but another ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different. We may therefore take my Propoſition for granted: yea we have ſhewn already, that any Fundamental Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or an Errour againſt any Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental point, great or little, if there be any Fundamental point of little concern, is deſtructive to the Being of a Church.</p>
               <p>He goes on, and ſaies, <hi>But if by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt an Article of Faith be meant, that a Church, which does not err at all in matters of Religion, cannot teach Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> then he concludes the Propoſition is <hi>true,</hi> but <hi>impertinent.</hi> Neither does this part of the diſtinction touch my Propoſition. For all matters of Religion are not Articles of Faith, according to Dr. <hi>St.</hi> who does not think all the 39. Articles to be Articles of Faith; yet he judges them all to be Articles, or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, and to concern the Soundneſs of a Church, but not the Eſſence: nay, we do not hold, that all the Ceremonies of our Church, and all our Eccleſiaſtical Precepts are Articles
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:102636:75"/>of Faith; yet they may be called mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion. Wherefore theſe two Propoſitions, <hi>A Church that does not err againſt any Article of Faith, and a Chuch that does not err at all in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> are very different: neither does the former Propoſition contain the latter. Is not this when a learned diſtinction, wherein neither part touches the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which the Author pretends to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh, whereas, according to all reaſon, Both Members of the Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are to be contained in the word, which is diſtinguiſhed?</p>
               <p>Would it not be ridiculous for one to diſtinguiſh thus the following Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Every man is a rational Animal?</hi> if by <hi>Man</hi> be meant <hi>all kind of Animals,</hi> 'tis falſe: But if by Man be meant only that kind of Animal, which is man, 'tis true. For as a man does not ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all kind of Animals, but only a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kind: So neither an Article of Faith does ſignifie all matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but only certain points. So that Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s diſtinction comes to be this: <hi>If by Articles of Faith, and Fundamental points of Religion</hi> be underſtood not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:102636:76"/>
                  <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> and <hi>Fundamental points,</hi> but alſo <hi>other points,</hi> which are neither <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> nor <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental;</hi> i. e. if by theſe words he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, <hi>what they do not ſignifie,</hi> then very wiſely the Dr. ſaies <hi>pag.</hi> 28. <hi>The Propoſition is true, but impertinent:</hi> as certainly it is impertinent. But who makes it ſo? But if by <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> and <hi>Fundamental points of Religion,</hi> be only underſtood <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> and <hi>Fundamental points of Religion,</hi> as who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has any underſtanding in him, muſt needs underſtand; Then — what then? — he ſaies not a word to the Propoſition layed down by me, <hi>viz. A Church that does not err against any Article of Faith, nor againſt any Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental point of Religion, does not teach Idolatry:</hi> Whereas, according to the common Rules of diſtinguiſhing Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, he ſhould have told us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Propoſition, qualified with that part of the Diſtinction, was true, or falſe: But he coggs in another Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion very different, ſaying, <hi>That a Church, which does not own all Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Doctrine, may be guilty of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry.</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:102636:76"/>Let any one judge, whether this be not downright juggling. Whence the Reader may eaſily ſee, to what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities this poor man is brought, to make good againſt us his pretended Charge of Idolatry, and to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from Self-contradiction.</p>
               <p>Moreover, either he does admit <hi>other Articles of Faith,</hi> and <hi>Fundamental points of Religion,</hi> beſides thoſe which are <hi>contained in the Apostles Creed,</hi> or not: if he does admit others, then the Diſtinction would run thus; If by not erring againſt <hi>any Article of Faith</hi> be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that a Church, which does not err againſt <hi>ſome certain Articles of Faith,</hi> cannot teach Idolatry; <hi>i. e.</hi> if in place of my Propoſition, which is an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Negative,</hi> be put in another Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition very different, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Particular Negative,</hi> then the Propoſition, which he puts in, may be falſe; as certainly it may be: for a Church may teach Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, without erring againſt <hi>every Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> of Faith: as the Heathens, who admitted a Deity and a Religion, did not err againſt every Article of Faith, though they taught Idolatry. But this
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102636:77"/>cannot hinder the truth of my Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which was an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Negative,</hi> viz. <hi>not erring againſt any;</hi> when as his Propoſition would be a <hi>particular Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> viz. <hi>not erring againſt ſome.</hi> As, this <hi>univerſal is true, a man that does not tranſgreſs any of Gods Commandments, is a good man:</hi> but this other particular may be falſe, <hi>A man that does not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſome certain Commandments of God, viz.</hi> thoſe, which concern immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the honour of God, <hi>is a good man:</hi> neither could the falſity of this latter Propoſition obſtruct the truth of the former.</p>
               <p>But if Dr. <hi>St.</hi> admits no Articles at all of Faith, nor Fundamental points, which are not contained, explicitely nor implicitely, in the Apoſtles Creed, then he muſt needs reduce to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed the Article quoted in my firſt Propoſition, <hi>viz. The honour, which is due only to God, is not to be given to a meer Creature;</hi> ſince he grants this to be an Article of Faith, and a Fundamental point of Religion, as has been ſeen; and doubtleſs 'tis a main Fundamental point too.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:102636:77"/>
               <p>And this is enough for the truth of our third Propoſition: For, if a Church does not err againſt any Article of Faith, even of thoſe which the Dr. grants to be ſuch, ſhe does not err a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the forementioned Article, which even the Dr. places amongſt Articles of Faith: and if it does not err againſt this Article, it does not teach Idolatry, at leaſt that kind of Idolatry, which he is pleaſed to father upon us. For to teach any ſort of Idolatry, at leaſt that which the Dr. laies to our charge, is to err a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the aforeſaid Article, (which not only in our opinion, but alſo in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Dr. and other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, is an Article of Faith) as does manifeſtly appear, by what has been handled in our Second Propoſition.</p>
               <p>My fourth Propoſition was framed thus. <hi>The Church of Rome does teach Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Images, Adoration of the Hoaſt, and Invocation of Saints.</hi> To this Dr. <hi>St.</hi> page 29. anſwers, <hi>That it is agreed on by both ſides,</hi> without adding any more. Now I ſee the Dr. takes heart, and dares to grant a Propoſition ſet down by me, without ſtigmatizing it
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:102636:78"/>either before or after, for Sophiſtical and Captious. Hence I infer, that the Veneration of Images, Adoration of the Hoaſt, and Invocation of the Saints, are Doctrines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and by conſequence they are not <hi>meer practices</hi> of <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi> For when a practice of the members of any Chuch is taught, and approved by the Church her ſelf, then ſuch a practice comes to be the Doctrine of that Church. This I have ſaid, becauſe ſometimes Dr. <hi>St.</hi> does ſeem to look upon the forementioned points, as <hi>meer practices</hi> of <hi>Roman-Catholicks:</hi> and it is certain, that a Church may be a True Church, and yet the Members thereof pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice ſome things contrary to the Doctrine, and Tenets of the Church, whoſe members they are. For the Dr. will not deny, that among Proteſtants there are ſome, nay many, who although they aſſent to the Tenets of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church, do contradict, in their practice, the Doctrine they profeſs to believe, being Adulterers, Thieves, Perjurers, and Drunkards, living as if there were no God, according to that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102636:78"/>of St. <hi>Paul, Titus</hi> 1.16. quoted by Dr. <hi>St. pag.</hi> 25. ſpeaking of ſome, who profeſs that <hi>they know God, but in works they deny him.</hi> And yet ſure the Dr. will not therefore affirm, that the Proteſtant Church is not a true, and ſound Church. However, ſhould ſhe teach Adultery, Thieving, and Perjury to be lawful, or that <hi>there is no God,</hi> certainly the Dr. in that caſe would not hold her for a True, much leſs for a Sound Church, Our preſent debate therefore is concerning the Doctrines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and whether Dr. <hi>St.</hi> does not Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himſelf, by aſſerting, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is a True Church, and yet that ſhe does teach Idolatry, or thoſe things wherein it lies.</p>
               <p>My fifth, and laſt Propoſition goes thus: <hi>The Roman Church does not err a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any Article of Faith, or Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental point of Religion.</hi> Dr. <hi>St.</hi> does confeſs, <hi>pag.</hi> 29. <hi>That this is his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion: from whence all the force of our Argument is taken:</hi> and we do not deny, but that this Conceſſion of the Dr. is of great concern in order to our preſent Deſign. All the endeavours therefore of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102636:79"/>the Dr. are bent to ſhew in <hi>what ſenſe this Conceſſion is made by him, and of what force it is in this preſent Debate.</hi> I prove this to be Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s Sentiment, (which ſome did queſtion, when my book firſt came forth, as I inſinuated above) from ſeveral places, quoted out of his <hi>Rat. Account:</hi> amongſt the reſt I alledged the <hi>page</hi> 54, 55. where he affirms (adding that this is the ſenſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church) That thoſe points, which they defend in oppoſition to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and wherein only they impeach us of Errours, agreeing with us in the reſt, <hi>are meer pious Opinions, and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Truths, which no body is obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> either <hi>neceſſitate medij,</hi> or <hi>neceſſitate praecepti:</hi> and conſequently that they are not Articles of Faith, or Fundamental points of Religion; every one being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, either <hi>neceſſitate medij,</hi> or <hi>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Praecepti,</hi> to believe all ſuch points: and he expreſsly aſſerts in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned pages, praiſing thence the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, that ſhe does not acknowledge any thing, as an Article of Faith, which is not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as ſuch by <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. Since
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102636:79"/>therefore 'tis manifeſt, that <hi>Rome</hi> does not acknowledge as Articles of Faith, thoſe Points which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church maintains in oppoſition to her, it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently follows, according to Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s Conceſſion, that neither the Church of <hi>England</hi> does acknowledge ſuch points as Articles of Faith.</p>
               <p>Whence I ſhew'd the truth of this our Propoſition, againſt Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and his Cabal. The ſubſtance of the Argument is this.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not err, nor cannot err, againſt any Article of Faith, or Fundamental point of Religion; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the points, at leaſt ſome of them, againſt which ſhe is ſuppoſed to err, be Articles of Faith, or Fundamental points of Religion. This is evident.</p>
               <p>But none of theſe points, againſt which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſuppoſes the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to err, are in his opinion either Articles of Faith, or Fundamental points of Religion, as manifeſtly appears by what we have quoted even now out of him: for he ſuppoſes her to err only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe points, wherein the Church of <hi>England</hi> differs from us; which in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102636:80"/>his opinion are no Articles of Faith.</p>
               <p>Therefore, according to Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church does not err againſt any Article of Faith, or Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental point of Religion; which is the Propoſition ſet down by me.</p>
               <p>Neither can the Dr. ſay, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does err im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately only againſt thoſe points, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church defends in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition unto her; yet theſe points being connexed with Articles of Faith, ſhe cannot err againſt theſe, without erring mediately, and by conſequence, againſt Articles of Faith: he cannot, I ſay, affirm this. For otherwiſe he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver grant this our Fifth Propoſition, as he does: Becauſe to err mediately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an Article, is to err againſt that, and another point too; and ſo he ſhould abſolutely have denyed, That the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church does not err againſt any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith: which he does not. In the like manner it would be ridiculous to affirm, <hi>That one did not kill ſuch a man,</hi> becauſe he did not immediately deſtroy the Union between the Soul, and the Body; in the diſſolution whereof death
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102636:80"/>formally conſiſts; but only mediately and by conſequence, becauſe he deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome diſpoſition, neceſſary to the conſervation of that Union: as if one Arraigned for having killed a man, ſhould anſwer, <hi>That he did not kill him; That he only cut off his Head.</hi> Nay, if thoſe particular Tenets of the Proteſtant Church are ſo connexed, and linked with Articles of Faith, that whoever denies, or deſtroies the former, muſt alſo deny, and deſtroy the latter, one would be obliged <hi>neceſſitate medij,</hi> or <hi>praecepti,</hi> not to diſſent from ſuch points; Becauſe we are obliged not to deny any Article of Faith; and conſequently not to deny any thing, which being once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, an Article of Faith is alſo denyed, and caſhiered: which is contrary to what he aſſerts in the place above quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: where he affirms, that men are prohibited to oppoſe them [particular Tenets of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church] exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourly, but not to diſſent from them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriourly: So becauſe men are prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to kill others, they are obliged, not to deſtroy any Diſpoſition, whereon the life of man neceſſarily depends.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:102636:81"/>
               <p>Nor is this Fifth Propoſition laid down by me, only as Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s and his Aſſociates opinion; but, as I proved in my Book, it is alſo the common aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of other Proteſtants; ſome of them averring This to be the judgment of all Learned Proteſtants, accuſing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary party of their Brethren of <hi>an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Zeal;</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> adds they <hi>are worthy to be burnt.</hi> Hence is that common ſpeech of Proteſtants, boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Charity therein, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church doth not teach <hi>any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Fundamental, Damnable, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to Salvation;</hi> That ſhe does not err in the <hi>Foundations,</hi> but in the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purſtructures;</hi> nor in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> but only in <hi>Not-fundamentals;</hi> nor againſt <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> but againſt <hi>inferiour Truths</hi> only. Now to err in <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi> or to admit a <hi>Fundamental</hi> Errour, is to err againſt a <hi>Fundamental Truth.</hi> Whence I conclude, that according to the conſtant perſwaſion, not only of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and his Partizans, but alſo of all Learned Proteſtants, <hi>The Roman Church does not Err againſt any Article of Faith, or Fundamental point of Religion:</hi> which
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:102636:81"/>was the very Propoſition I laid down in the fifth, and laſt place.</p>
               <p>Let's examin yet farther, how Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſtill boggles at the forementioned Propoſition. All that in ſubſtance he ſaies is this, <hi>That he never granted the Roman Church to be a Sound Church,</hi> or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that ſhe did not err in ſome matters of Religion, requiſite to the <hi>Soundneſs,</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> of a Church: neither can he ſhew, that I alledged him to the contrary: neither does this fifth Propoſition expreſs any ſuch thing, as is manifeſt. What therefore here, and in other places, he confeſſedly grants, is, <hi>That our Church is a True Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring against all Fundamental, and Eſſential points of Religion, and againſt all Articles of Faith:</hi> which is all that is neceſſary to the <hi>abſolute Truth</hi> of the forementioned Propoſition. Wherefore, as it would be very abſurd to anſwer one, who intending only to prove ſuch a perſon not to be dead, ſhould take this Propoſition, <hi>Such a perſon is yet a true man, retaining all the Eſſentials of a man,</hi> to anſwer (I ſay) that what he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouches of him is <hi>true;</hi> but that ſuch a
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102636:82"/>perſon is not a <hi>ſound</hi> man: So it is very impertinent, when I propoſed only to him, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church does not err againſt any <hi>Article of Faith, or Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental point of Religion,</hi> requiſite to the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of a True Church, (as all <hi>Fundamental</hi> points are) to tell me, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church does err againſt <hi>ſome points</hi> of Religion, requiſite only to the <hi>Soundneſs</hi> of a Church: ſuch as he fancies the particular Tenets of the Proteſtant Church to be: which is to tell me in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> That <hi>what I ſay is true,</hi> but <hi>what I ſay not is falſe:</hi> which anſwer is very impertinent, and good for nothing, but to trifle away the time.</p>
               <p>And hence will appear, of what force this Conceſſion of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Deſign; which is to ſhew him guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Self-contradiction, by granting our Church, not to err againſt any <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental</hi> point of Religion; and yet affirming that ſhe teaches Idolatry, and ſuch groſs Idolatry. For, to teach Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, eſpecially ſuch a groſs Idolatry, as he is pleaſed to Father upon us, is, according to his own expreſs aſſertion,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102636:82"/>to teach, or require, <hi>that the Honour, or Worſhip due only to the Creator, be given to to a Creature;</hi> and to teach this is to err againſt the contrary Truth, <hi>viz. The Honour which is due only to the Creator, is not to be given to a Creature,</hi> as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: and conſequently it is to err a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Fundamental point of Religion. For ſuch does Dr. <hi>St.</hi> acknowledge to be the aforeſaid Truth. Whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that to ſay our Church does not err againſt any Fundamental point; and yet that ſhe does teach ſuch groſs Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as he is pleaſed to faſten upon her, is to ſay, <hi>That ſhe does not err againſt any, and yet that ſhe does err againſt ſome:</hi> which is a palpable Contradiction.</p>
               <p>Were the Idolatry he Fathers upon us, deſtructive only to ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite meerly to the Soundneſs of a Church, and to ſome Non-fundamental point, his diſtinction would have been to ſome purpoſe. But ſince the Idolatry he laies to our Charge, is deſtructive, according to our own Conceſſion, to ſomething requiſite to the very Being of a Church, <hi>viz.</hi> to a Fundamental, and Eſſential point; the forementioned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102636:83"/>of the Truth, and Soundneſs of a Church is altogether frivolous.</p>
               <p>Finally, Dr. <hi>St. pag.</hi> 32. ſpeaking in particular concerning our fifth Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſaies, <hi>That if this Aſſertion, The Church of Rome does not err againſt any point neceſsary to Salvation, be only meant of thoſe Eſſential points of Faith,</hi> which he ſuppoſes <hi>antecedently neceſſary to the Being of a Church,</hi> he denies it not; and he makes the antient Creeds of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, (before he had made mention only of the Apoſtles Creed) <hi>to be the beſt meaſure of thoſe things, which were believed to be neceſsary to Salvation.</hi> But he adds That <hi>he does not ſee, of what uſe the forementioned Conceſſion of his can be to us in the preſent debate, unleſs we can ſhew</hi> (which he ſuppoſes we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver able to doe) <hi>that whatever Church does embrace the antient Creeds, and own all the Articles of Faith, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them, cannot be guilty of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi> But this anſwer of the Dr. is ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſame exceptions we produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt him, in the Explanation of our Third Propoſition. For 'tis a very different thing to ſay, <hi>A Church, that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102636:83"/>embraces, and owns all Eſſential points of Faith,</hi> (which is the Dr. 's Propoſition) <hi>and a Church that does not err againſt any Eſſential point of Faith;</hi> (which is our Propoſition, tacitely at leaſt granted by him:) For a Church may contradict her ſelf, and err againſt thoſe very points, which ſhe embraces, and owns: how can the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be a True Church, as the Dr. often confeſſes ſhe is, unleſs ſhe be free from all Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Errours? and how can ſhe be free from all Fundamental Errours, if ſhe errs againſt any Fundamental point? and finally, how does ſhe not err againſt a Fundamental point, if ſhe teaches Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, yea the groſſeſt Idolatry of the world?</p>
               <p>Whence I conclude, that not only this main Propoſition is granted by him in the ſenſe I pretend, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the Roman Church does not err againſt any Article of Faith, or Fundamental point of Religion,</hi> even of thoſe, which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges to be ſuch: but alſo, that this his Conceſſion is effectual to evince our preſent deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> to clear the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church from the Idolatry caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:102636:84"/>her, and to prove the Dr. guilty of Self-contradiction, by granting, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church does not err againſt any Fundamental point of Faith, and yet charging her with Idolatry, and with ſuch groſs Idolatry.</p>
               <p>To ſay the truth, I would never deſire an Adverſarie to grant me more, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to confute him, than Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has, and does grant in the preſent debate. For theſe Five Propoſitions ſet down by me, are either abſolutely granted by the Dr. or at leaſt not denyed by him <hi>in the ſenſe I pretended;</hi> as is apparent, by what has been diſcuſs'd: and we take this Non-denial of the Dr. for a grant, or conſent; according to that Maxime, <hi>Qui tacet, conſentire videtur.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly had he thought them falſe, he would have denyed them: whenas he does not ſo much as deny one of them, <hi>in the ſenſe intended;</hi> but ſome other Propoſitions very different.</p>
               <p>Wherefore theſe Propoſitions being granted in the conformity aforeſaid, the method I took was to deduce from them the contradictory of the Calumny caſt upon our Church by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> For, to lay
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102636:84"/>down Propoſitions, or Principles, and to deduce nothing from them, is, as if one ſhould lay Foundations without building the Superſtructures: as to make Deductions without firſt laying Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, (as ſome do) is to build with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Foundation. And becauſe ſome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, others will not make by themſelves the deductions; eſpecially when they are contrary to what formerly they have imbibed, and are reſolved to maintain, I thought it beſt to make them to their hand. However, becauſe the main, nay the ſole, exception, that ſome perſons had againſt my Book, was, becauſe I uſed a Scholaſtick Method, framing my deductions in a ridged Syllogiſtical form, it ſeems to me expedient, for the ſatisfaction of ſuch perſons, to produce here the reaſons, that moved me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: which are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe this method I took, is a cloſe, clear, ſhort, and convincing way; and ſince I deſired, in a matter of ſo great concern, and not having too much time, to be quick, cloſe, clear, and ſhort with my Adverſary, in order to convince him of Self-contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102636:85"/>I made choice of this Method.</p>
               <p>Secondly, all Diſcourſes whatſoever, looſe, or not looſe, do neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſome Syllogiſme; wherein the truth one endeavours to prove, is inferred, or pretended to be inferred, from ſome Principles. And although all kinds of Diſcourſes are obnoxious to Fallacies, and Sophiſtry; yet this difference there is between Looſe, or Rhetorical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and Logical, or not Looſe, that in Rhetorical Diſcourſes, as being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly interlaced with ſeveral digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and gay Metaphors, which amuze the Reader, the fallacy is eaſily diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But in ridged Syllogiſtical Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, deveſted from gaudy Expreſſions, quaint Metaphors, and unneceſſary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, the Fallacy, if there be any, is with far leſs difficulty detected. And this is the reaſon, that when we will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the Sophiſtry of a looſe diſcourſe, we do commonly reduce it to a Syllogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical form, the better to diſcover it. Now becauſe I deſired to deal fairly, and ſincerely with Dr. <hi>St.</hi> I made uſe of this method; to the end, that were there any fallacie in my Syllogiſms, it
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102636:85"/>might more eaſily appear unto him. And although in almoſt every page he impeaches me of Sophiſtry &amp; Captiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet he do's not legally ſhew any one of my Syllogiſms to be lyable to any of the Fallacies, the Logicians make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of: and one would think, that a Dr. or of Divinity ſhould not be ignorant of them: and all that he does in this kind is, as appears by the inſtances above produced, Firſt he feigns me to ſpeak what I do not, and then he affirms, that I ſpeak Sophiſtically, and Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, 'tis the common ſtile of our Polemical Divines here in <hi>England,</hi> whether Catholicks or Proteſtants, to uſe this Syllogiſtical way, both in their Books and conferences, concerning matters of Religion, when they will write or ſpeak cloſe to the Subject they handle. Let my Adverſary be a preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; who in his Anſwer to the two Queſtions propoſed by one of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he reduces almoſt all his Diſcourſes to formal Syllogiſms, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he laboured that Anſwer, only for the ſatisfaction of a Lady; and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102636:86"/>do not uſe to be much verſt in Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Logick, or formal Syllogiſms. And in the late Diſputes betwen the Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts and Quakers, the greateſt of their Auditory being made up of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Tradeſmen, who have not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented Univerſities, yet their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were framed in a Syllogiſtical way.</p>
               <p>Since therefore I had never heard this common method of treating Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies reprehended in our Divines, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants or Catholicks; and being more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over inclined thereunto, as having been bred, the greateſt part of my life in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Univerſities, where a Scholaſtick, and Dialectical method is moſt in vogue, I thought no juſt exception would be made againſt me, ſhould I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge my ſelf in a thing nothing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, and ſuitable to my inclination: eſpecially when I intended my Book particularly for learned men, who are not unacquainted with Syllogiſms. And for the ſatisfaction of Proteſtants in this matter, 'twill without doubt be enough to ſee, that my Adverſary, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſeems to have been reſolved
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:102636:86"/>to pardon me in nothing which he could find to be any way obnoxious to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, has not carped at me upon this account. However, if any one be not ſatisfied with theſe Reaſons, he may paſs over the Formal Syllogiſms, laid down at the cloſing of each point, in <hi>Dr. Stillingfleet againſt Dr. Stillingfleet:</hi> only I deſire him to make the Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by himſelf, in the manner he ſhall think beſt.</p>
               <p>The Two Syllogiſms therefore, wherewith, out of the Propoſitions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned, and aſſented unto by the Doctor, I demonſtrated the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be free from Idolatry in the <hi>Veneration of Images, Adoration of the Hoaſt,</hi> and <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> were theſe:</p>
               <p>A Church that does not err againſt any <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> or <hi>Fundamental point of Religion,</hi> does not teach Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. See <hi>Prop.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is a Church, that does not err againſt any <hi>Article of Faith, or Fundamental point of Religion.</hi> See <hi>Prop.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſhe does not teach <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:102636:87"/>
               <p>But ſhe does teach <hi>Veneration of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Adoration of Christ in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,</hi> and <hi>Invocation of Saints.</hi> See <hi>Prop.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Therefore none of theſe Practices, as taught, and allowed of, by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, are Idolatry.</p>
               <p>We may add this farther Diſcourſe: A Church, that does not err againſt this Fundamental point, <hi>viz. The Honour due only to the Creator, is not to be given to the Creature,</hi> does not teach Idolatry; all Idolatry being deſtructive to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned point. See <hi>Prop.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>But ſuch is the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as is evident by the fifth Propoſition.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſhe does not teach <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hence manifeſtly appears, how palpably Dr. <hi>St.</hi> Contradicts himſelf, in charging the <hi>Roman</hi> Church with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and yet granting her to be a True Church, unerring againſt <hi>all Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</hi> For it is as much, as if he had ſaid, ſhe does <hi>not err againſt any Fundamental point,</hi> yet ſhe <hi>does err againſt ſome.</hi>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Several Quibbles againſt the aforeſaid Doctrine removed.</head>
               <p>FRom what we have hitherto ſet down, may eaſily be anſwer'd ſeveral Quibbles, which <hi>Dr. St.</hi> &amp; others, do, or may, object againſt the Doctrine above eſtabliſhed. The Doctor often inſinuates that there are two ſorts of Idolary. The one conſiſtent with the Being, but not with the Soundneſs of a Church: The other inconſiſtent with the very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Church: and he makes the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church guilty of the former kind of Idolatry, and not of the latter. Whence he concludes, that he does not commit any Contradiction by charging the <hi>Roman</hi> Church with this ſort of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and yet granting her to be a true Church. But this objection vaniſhes to nothing; becauſe we have ſhewn, that the general notion of Idolatry, allowed by the Dr. is inconſiſtent with a <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,</hi> and <hi>Eſſential</hi> point of Religion;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102636:88"/>and conſequently with the very Being of a True Church. And ſince there can be no kind of Idolatry, which does not participate the general notion of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as is evident, it manifeſtly follows, that all ſorts poſſible of Idolatry are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Being of a Church.</p>
               <p>Moreover, we have already demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> affirms, in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces quoted above, the Idolatry allowed of by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be as bad, nay worſe, than the groſſeſt Idolatry of the Heathens. Now if the groſſeſt Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of the Heathens be deſtructive to the Being of a Church, as certainly it is, (neither does, nor can Dr. <hi>St.</hi> deny it) how is it credible, that an Idolatry yet worſe than that, ſhould be conſiſtent with the Being, and Eſſence of a True Church? The Dr. might as well, with the ſubtlety of his wit, diſtinguiſh two Antichriſts; the one, that is contrary to Chriſt; the other, though worſe than the former, that is not contrary to Chriſt, but his intimate Friend. For I am confident, that one may as eaſily find out an Antichriſt, not contrary to Chriſt, as an Idolatry not dſtructive to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102636:88"/>the Being of a True Church. In the like manner he might ſay, (and therein he would highly oblige the Libertins of our Nation) that there are two ſorts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, the one, inconſiſtent with a good life; the other, though far worſe than the former, yet conſiſtent with it: and then tells us, that one cannot be a good, and pious man, and yet a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchee in the former ſenſe; But that if one be a Debauchee in the latter ſenſe, (which is yet far more horrible, than the former) he may very well be a good and pious man, without the leaſt ſhew of Contradiction: and then laugh at us, as half-witted men, becauſe we cannot underſtand theſe Niceties.</p>
               <p>Certainly, there has never been yet in the world a man, who has more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged Idolaters, than Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has done. I, and many more with me, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes believed, that there is no Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which is not Idolatry; and that all Idolatry is inconſiſtent with the Being of a True Church. But the incomparable Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has found out one Idolatry, that is no-Idolatry; another Idolatry, which kills a Church; another, though
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:102636:89"/>worſe than the former, that makes her only ſick; and another finally, that is an Eſſential perfection, and a neceſſary ingredient of a True Church; as we ſhall ſee, when we come to examin his Anſwer to our Appendix. Now ſince the Dr. has invented ſuch pretty kinds of Idolatry, who can blame him for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our Church, both True and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous?</p>
               <p>Again the Dr. anſwers, (clear himſelf from Self-contradiction) that he never affirmed, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church did, or does teach in expreſs terms, any ſort of Idolatry, or that <hi>the honour due only to God, may be given to a meer Creature.</hi> But that ſhe only teaches thoſe things, wherein Idolatry lies: which is not to teach Idolatry expreſsly: as for inſtance, ſhe does not teach the Veneration ſhe exhibits to Images to be Idolatry, and yet lawful; for that would be to teach Idolatry in expreſs terms: but rather ſhe affirms the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That the forementioned Veneration is not Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous: for ſhe thinks, that the honour ſhe exhibits to Images, is not Divine Worſhip: however, becauſe the Dr.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102636:89"/>will have her to be miſtaken in theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, he impeaches her of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>Now the Subſtance of this Anſwer comes to be, that although to ſay, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is a True Church, and yet that ſhe does teach Idolatry in expreſs terms, be a palpable Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; yet there is no appearance of contradiction in ſaying, as he does, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is a True Church, but yet that ſhe does teach thoſe things wherein Idolatry lies; which are his words, <hi>pag,</hi> 29. or that ſhe does teach Idolatry, not in expreſs terms, but only by Conſequence, as he ſaies <hi>pag.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>But I leave to others to examin, how this does agree, with what Dr. <hi>St.</hi> affirms, in ſeveral places of his Diſcourſe concerning the Idolatry practiſed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: endeavouring to ſhew, that ſhe does expreſsly act againſt the <hi>Second Commandment</hi> of God, (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their account) wherein is prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited Idolatry) when ſhe teaches the Veneration, and Worſhip of Images.</p>
               <p>Beſides, this objection is caſhiered, by what has been already diſcuſs'd. For
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:102636:90"/>ſince the Idolatry Dr. <hi>St.</hi> fathers upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is deſtructive to a Fundamental point of Religion, and conſequently to the very Being of a True Church, as has been already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, 'tis impoſſible, that a Church, remaining a True Church, ſhould teach ſuch an Idolatry, either in expreſs terms, or by good Conſequence: and as the Dr. will not grant, that to teach Idolatry only by Conſequence, teaching thoſe things wherein it lies, is enough to free the <hi>Roman</hi> Church from being really Idolatrous; otherwiſe by this Anſwer he himſelf would diſcharge her from the Crime of Idolatry he caſts upon her; ſo neither can it excuſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Church from being no True Church; the oppoſiteneſs of Idolatry with the Eſſence of a Church, conſiſting in the Reality of the thing, and not in the particular perſwaſion of ſuch as teach it. Wherefore to ſay, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is a True Church, and yet that ſhe does teach Idolatry in the manner aforementioned, is to commit a palpable Contradiction.</p>
               <p>Moreover, 'tis certain, neither can the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:102636:90"/>Dr. queſtion it, that the Churches of the groſſeſt ſort of Heathens, did teach Idolatry, <hi>deſtructive to the being of a true Church,</hi> and in a manner deſtructive thereunto; and yet they did not teach Idolatry in expreſs terms, but only by Conſequence, teaching thoſe things wherein it did lie. For either they did affirm (though by miſtake) that the object, to which they gave Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, was not a meer Creature; or that the honour they gave, was not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Divine. For what Heathen did ever teach in expreſs terms, That <hi>the honour due only to God, may be given to a meer Creature?</hi> So that were this objection of any force, it would excuſe the groſſeſt Heathens from practiſing, or teaching any Idolatry, deſtructive to the Eſſence of a True Church. Nay, if Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, becauſe it is taught, not in expreſs terms, but by conſequence, is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the Being of a Church, he might alſo affirm, that upon the ſame account it is neither deſtructive to the ſoundneſs of it; and conſequently the <hi>Roman</hi> Church would not be, according to the Dr. 's opinion, not only True,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102636:91"/>but Sound alſo. For if this Doctrine be true, the deſtructiveneſs of Idolatry is not to be taken from the thing, which is practiſed or taught, but from the manner of practſing it, or teaching it. All Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, if they be truly ſuch, are deſtructive to the very Being of a True Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſeparate the Societies that profeſs them, from the Church of Chriſt, as the very notion of Hereſie does import: yet according to this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the Doctor, they would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Eſſence of a True Church; becauſe there is no Heretical Church, which is not miſtaken in ſome thing that it teaches; or which does teach to be an Errour or Hereſie, that which ſhe maintains as a Truth: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe teaches thoſe things, wherein her particular Hereſie lies, and becauſe ſhe teaches to be true what really is an Errour, and an Errour contrary to an Article of Faith; therefore ſhe is an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical, and no True Church.</p>
               <p>Whence it follows, that ſhould one affirm, that ſuch a Church is True, and yet that ſhe teaches thoſe things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Hereſie, and Errour againſt Faith
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102636:91"/>does lie, he would, beyond debate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelf: and if it be a contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion to affirm, that ſuch a Church is true, and yet Heretical, will it be no Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to defend, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is True, but yet Idolatrous? For certainly Idolatry is no leſs deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive to the Being of a Church, than Hereſie.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, as to kill a man, 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for one to do that, which neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily infers the Separation of the Soul from the Body, whether he does it by miſtake, or without miſtake; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, or not knowingly: So, to deſtroy the Being of a True Church, 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if ſhe teaches any Fundamental, or Eſſential Errour, deſtructive to the Eſſence thereof; as ſhe muſt neceſſarily do, if ſhe teaches Idolatry, whether ſhe teaches it in expreſs terms, or only by conſequence, whether by miſtake or not: For although miſtake may excuſe him, who has it, from erring maliciouſly, yet not from erring, nor the Church that ſhould teach ſuch an Errour, from being Erroneous.</p>
               <p>Since therefore Dr. <hi>St.</hi> does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Church from Erring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102636:92"/>this Fundamental point, <hi>The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due only to God, is not to be given to a meer Creature,</hi> he cannot excuſe her from a Fundamental Errour, inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the Being of a True Church; and conſequently he cannot excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from a manifeſt Contradiction, in granting the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be a True Church, and yet charging her with Doctrines containing Idolatry.</p>
               <p>After all theſe attempts, on the part of the Idolatry he fathers upon us, had proved unſucceſsful; he turns himſelf to the other part of the Contradiction, ſaying, that when he grants <hi>the Roman Church to be a True Church,</hi> he means thereby nothing elſe, but that <hi>ſhe does embrace all Eſſential points of Faith, couched in the Antient Creeds of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church;</hi> and he thinks it very far from any contradiction, to affirm, that a Church may embrace all ſuch points, and yet teach Idolatry: and therefore he ſaies, that although the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does own the Fundamentals of Chriſtian Faith contained in the Antient Creeds, yet ſhe debauches thoſe very Principles, which ſhe profeſſes to own,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102636:92"/>
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 34. This objection is alſo annulled, by what we have laid down above. Firſt, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> does not only grant, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church does embrace all the Eſſentials points of Chriſtian Faith, and conſequently amongſt the reſt this point, <hi>viz. The Honour due only to God, is not to be given to a meer Creature;</hi> which he confeſſes to be one of them: But alſo he allows, that ſhe does not err againſt any Fundamental point of Faith: this being my Fifth Propoſition; which he aſſents unto, and calls in his Conceſſion. Now to ſay, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church does not err againſt any Fundamental point, (as he ſaies ſhe does not) and yet that ſhe teaches Idolatry, (which is to err againſt a Fundamental point, even according to his Principles) is a palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contradiction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When Dr. <hi>St.</hi> grants our Church to be a True Church, as he does, without doubt he takes a True Church as contradiſtinct from a Falſe Church, or from a Church which is not True: otherwiſe he would interpret in a quite contrary ſenſe this his Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>The Roman Church is a True Church,</hi>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:102636:93"/>i.e. <hi>The Roman Church is no true Church;</hi> which interpretation cannot but ſeem to any prudent man very ridiculous. Now a Church may fail to be a True Church, either becauſe ſhe does not poſitively embrace ſome Eſſential point, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe denies ſome Eſſential point, and errs againſt it: and to the Eſſence of a True Church it is requiſite, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to embrace poſitively all Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal points, but alſo not to err againſt any one of them, as I have demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above. Neither do I think, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will deny it; otherwiſe he would, doubtleſs, have denyed our Fifth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Whoever therefore affirms, that our Church is a True Church, and yet that it errs againſt a Fundamental point, (as neceſſarily it muſt, if it main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Idolatry) does as much as affirm, it is True, and not True.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let's ſuppoſe, (ſince 'tis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a Church to contradict her ſelf) that a Church, embracing all the ancient Creeds, with the Articles contained in them, ſhould notwithſtanding contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict her ſelf, denying ſome of the main points couched in thoſe Creeds, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102636:93"/>owned by her, ſure Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will not ſay, that ſuch a Church is a True Church; and that by contradicting thoſe main Articles of Faith ſhe does only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch them, but not ruine, or deſtroy them. Certainly every Contradictory ruins it Contradictory, and every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary deſtroys its Contrary. Will the Dr. affirm, that the groſſeſt of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens Idolatry did only debauch, and not deſtroy, this Prindiple owned by them, <hi>viz. The honour due only to God is not to be given to a meer Creature?</hi> and after the Dr. has taken ſo much pains to ſhew, that the Veneration of Images, owned by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is point blank againſt their 2d Commandment, will he ſay now, it only debauches it, but does not deſtroy it? Wherefore Dr. <hi>St.</hi> cannot defend, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church does teach Idolatry, without granting, that ſhe contradicts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys a Fundamental point of Religion; neither can he grant, that ſhe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts a Fundamental point of Religion, and yet allow that ſhe is a True Church. So that to maintain on the one ſide that ſhe teaches Idolatry, and on the other,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:102636:94"/>that ſhe is a True Church. is to commit a manifeſt Contradiction.</p>
               <p>I inſinuated in my Book the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a way from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hinted at alſo by the Dr. <hi>pag.</hi> 50. which may contribute much to clear this matter. Suppoſe, as the cuſtome is in ſome Almanacks, which ſet down the true waies from one place to another, one ſhould deſcribe a True way, how we may go from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York;</hi> and ſetting down all the Towns, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers commonly mention, ſhould inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingle them with other places, that lie either the quite contrary way, or at leaſt quite out of the way; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, from <hi>Stamford,</hi> (which lies in the ordinary way) to the <hi>Fennes;</hi> thence to <hi>Salisbury;</hi> thence to <hi>Plimouth;</hi> thence to the <hi>Weſt- Indies,</hi> and if you pleaſe to <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> alſo: for you are alwayes in a true way from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York;</hi> only with this general advice, that whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you go out of the true way, you muſt turn back again; without ſpecifying which places are out of the way; which not: but ſetting them down all as parts of the True way. So that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:102636:94"/>does not go through all the places, put down in the forementioned deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, does not follow the way therein contained. Would not ſuch a deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a True way from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York</hi> be extream ridiculous? could there be a better piece of Drollery than this, for <hi>Poor Robins</hi> Almanack? or can any man of common ſenſe, knowing that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, ſet down in the aforeſaid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, lie quite out of the way from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> call the way there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a True way from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York?</hi> For certainly, whoever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands what he ſaies, muſt needs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by a True way from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> a way, that not only contains all the principal places from the one Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the other, but moreover does not contain any place quite out of the way.</p>
               <p>This is juſt our caſe with Dr. <hi>St.</hi> He freely confeſſes, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is a True Church, and a True way to Salvation; but withal he affirms, that ſhe does not only contain thoſe main points, which he thinks ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a True Church; but alſo other particular points, which he looks upon
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:102636:95"/>as groſs Idolatry, and open Violations of the Divine Law; and conſequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the Salvation of men: which particular points the <hi>Roman</hi> Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers, not as Errours, but as Truths, and Articles of Faith, which all are bound to aſſent unto. So that whoever denies any of thoſe particular points, can no more be a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, than if he denyed ſome of the main points of Chriſtianity, common both to Catholicks and Proteſtants. Now ſince Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is of this perſwaſion, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church teaches and requires groſs Idolatry, and open violations of Gods Laws, how can he ſay without manifeſtly contradicting himſelf, that notwithſtanding all this, ſhe is a True Church, and a True way to Heaven? Can a True way to Heaven be made up of a high way to Hell? as certainly I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry is: or is not Idolatry as far out of the way to Heaven, as the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> is out of the way from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York?</hi> The anſwer of the Dr. in effect is this. If you be a <hi>Roman</hi> Chatholick, you are in a True way to Heaven; and yet if you be a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, you
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102636:95"/>are quite out of the way to Heaven: and whether this be not pure non-ſenſe, I leave it to the judgment of any impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial perſon whatſoever. Whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that all men of Reſon muſt needs underſtand by a True Church, a Church that does not only poſitively embrace all thoſe points, and Articles, which are requiſite to the Being of a Church; but moreover does not teach, nor require any thing whatſoever deſtructive to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; as doubtleſs groſs Idolatry, and open Violations of the Divine Laws, are.</p>
               <p>As inſignificant and ſenſeleſs as this, is another evaſion, (or rather the ſame in other terms) the Dr. makes uſe of, <hi>viz.</hi> that we may be ſaved as Chriſtians, but not as <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks; and that we may be ſaved, if we repent; but not otherwiſe. And what <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick did ever affirm, that Proteſtants, or any Hereticks whatſoever, are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as Chriſtians; or becauſe they hold the general Principles of Chriſtianity, wherein they agree with good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? but only as holding the particular Errours of their reſpective Religions:
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102636:96"/>neither will they be damned, if they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. And yet Dr. <hi>St.</hi> pretends, that Proteſtants have a more Charitable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Catholicks, in order to their Salvation, than Catholicks have of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. See my book, <hi>pag.</hi> 7, 8. Yea, there is no Religion, which does not hold ſome general Truths, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>we ought to repent of our ſins, and retract our Errours; That we are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and do whatſoever God will have us believe, or do,</hi> and ſuch like: neither is any one damned for holding theſe Truths; nor if he ſincerely repents of all his ſins, and retracts all his errours: and yet ſure Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will not grant, that all Religions in the world are True, and the very ſame with Proteſtancy, as he ſaies ours is.</p>
               <p>The forementioned Anſwer of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> puts me in mind of what one anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Prince, who was alſo a Biſhop, when being checked by him for having committed ſome great miſdemeanour unbeſeeming a Biſhop, he ſaid, that <hi>he had done it as a Prince, not as a Biſhop;</hi> the other replyed, <hi>But if the Devil car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries away your Highneſs as a Prince, what
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102636:96"/>will become of you as a Biſhop?</hi> In the like manner, if Dr. <hi>St.</hi> affirms, that <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, as ſuch, are damned, can he imagin, that they will be ſaved as Chriſtians? In fine, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this anſwer of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> it is no more poſſible for <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks to be ſaved, than for a man to become a Horſe; which is altogether impoſſible. For the repugnancy that is, for a man to become a horſe, is not grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Generical Predicates,</hi> wherin he agrees with a Horſe; but upon his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial difference: and Dr. <hi>St.</hi> confeſſes the particular Tenets of <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks to be repugnant to Salvation; but not the general: and if this be the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Salvation he grants us, and whereof he ſo much vapours, what Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick ever denied it to Proteſtants? and to ſay, that we may be ſaved, if we repent of our particular Tenets, and recal them, (which we can never do without quitting the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion) is as much, as if he ſhould ſay, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion is a true way to Salvation, but that it will never carry you thither, unleſs you
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102636:97"/>quit it; which is, as I inſinuated in the place above quoted, a pretty piece of Non-ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Whence we conclude, that, as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> to ſhew that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church may be Idolatrous, though True, forges an Idolatry, which is no Idolatry; ſo to prove that ſhe may be a true Church, though Idolatrous, he feigns a true Church that is no true Church. And who can wonder now, that <hi>Whitby</hi> ſhould ſtile Dr. <hi>St.</hi> a Prodigy of Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity and Learning; ſince he has been able to invent ſuch prodigious diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a true Church, no true Church; and of an Idolatry, no Idolatry.</p>
               <p>And hence by the way, I infer a thing of great comfort for <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, which is, that when they hear their Church impeached of Idolatry, in ſo many Ballads cryed through the ſtreets, and in ſo many Pamphlets, that lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Stationers Stall, there is no more meant by the Idolatry they accuſe us of, than an Idolatry that is no Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; or an Idolatry that is an eſſential per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the true Religion: and there is no great harm to be feared from ſuch Idolatries as theſe.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:102636:97"/>
               <p>One thing there is, that I cannot but wonder at; which is, that ſince Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is ſo eminent in compoſing things, though never ſo oppoſite one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Anabaptiſts and Quakers did not chuſe him for Arbiter in their late Conteſts concerning Religion. For though the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> had proved the <hi>Quakers</hi> no <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; notwithſtanding the Dr. out of his immenſe charity, would have demonſtrated, that they were both ſtill of the very ſame Religion, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, but even with him alſo. For if he be able to bring to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition things, that grin ſo much one at the other, as a True Church and an Idolatrous Church, even with the groſſeſt ſort of Idolatry, what will he not compoſe? and if he be ſo charitable as to make his own Church the very ſame in ſubſtance with an Idolatrous Church, why not alſo with a No Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church? beſides, the Quakers and Anabaptiſts follow the very ſame Rule, whereby Dr. <hi>St.</hi> regulates Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy. See his Principles, 5, 13, 15. For after a ſober and ſincere enquiry
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:102636:98"/>made into the Truth, (and whether they have made ſuch an enquiry or not, they muſt be their own Judges, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being bound to ſubmit to any Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Guide) they follow the <hi>Light within,</hi> or <hi>a faculty in them of diſcerning Truth and Falſhood, in matters propoſed to their Belief:</hi> whereby they <hi>judge of the Truth of Divine Revelation,</hi> and of the <hi>Genuine ſenſe thereof.</hi> So that, if this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty (which is, and ought to be, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Dr. <hi>their ſole Guide</hi>) tells them, <hi>That Chriſt is not God, That Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion is not true, or that there is no Scripture;</hi> All goes well, and they are of the very ſame Religion with Dr. <hi>St.</hi> adjuſting themſelves to his very rule. A late Book, entituled <hi>A Treatiſe of Humane Reaſon,</hi> diſguſted much the Proteſtants as I have heard: and yet it is nothing elſe, but an abſtract of thoſe very <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Grounds,</hi> whereon this Champion of Proteſtancy, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> builds the Vindication of the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
               <p>Finally, becauſe the Dr. ſeems ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream fond of his diſtinction of a True Church, and a Sound Church, inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:102636:98"/>above, it will not be amiſs to examin what he can mean by a Sound Church, and ſecure way to Salvation; which in this debate ſignifie the ſame. Does he mean by it a Church, that is free from all difficulties, and Temptations? if ſo, then there is no True Church in the world, that is ſound and ſecure. For, even according to our Saviours Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the true way to Heaven is nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and difficult, beſet with ſeveral dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and temptations; which render the Salvation of men extream hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and encompaſſed on all with croſs and by-paths, and dark turnnings; wherein many are miſs-led; yea Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, taken in its greateſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, contains high Myſteries, not eaſie to be aſſented unto; and hard Precepts which go againſt the grain of our nature; and many miſcarry, deterred by theſe difficulties. Does he therefore mean by it a Church qualified with ſuch Laws, that whoever keeps cloſe to them till death, (and let the way to Salvation be never ſo ſecure, yet if one does not keep to it 'till death, what will it avail him?) will certainly be ſaved. If this
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:102636:99"/>be his meaning, there is no True Church which is not ſound and ſecure, in this ſenſe. For a True Church muſt contain all things neceſſary to Salvation, both in order to our Belief, and Practice, as is certain: neither does Dr. <hi>St.</hi> deny it: and ſure, whoever dies, having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged all things neceſſary to his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well in reference to his Belief, as Practice, will certainly be ſaved; as is manifeſt from thoſe words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Si vis ad vitam ingredi, ſerva man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>data:</hi> which is a much as if he had ſaid, whoever obſerves my Commandments, ſhall certainly be ſaved: and doubtleſs no Body can do all, that is neceſſary to Salvation, without obſerving Gods Commandments.</p>
               <p>Does he mean by it a Church, that does not teach any thing whatſoever, as an Article of Faith, which is either an Errour, or Corruption? This ſeems to be his meaning. But neither is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that any Church whatſoever ſhould be a True Church, and yet not ſound, and ſecure in this ſenſe. For it is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Contradiction to affirm, That ſuch a Church is a True Church, but
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:102636:99"/>yet that ſhe fathers upon God, or teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es God to be the Author of ſome Errour or Corruption; as neceſſarily ſhe muſt, if ſhe teaches any Errour or Corruption, as an Article of Faith. A True Church muſt not err againſt any Fundamental point of Faith, as is certain; nor conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, againſt this point, <hi>God is not the Author of any Errour or Corruption whatſoever:</hi> which, doubtleſs, is Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental. A true Church therefore muſt not teach any Errour or Corruption, as an Article of Faith; or (which is the ſame) muſt not teach God to be the Author of any Errour, or Corruption. For to teach this, is to err againſt the forementioned point.</p>
               <p>Does he mean by it a Church, that does not require, or enjoyn, any Pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, or any other thing, deſtructive to Salvation; as doubtleſs all Idolatry is, whether ſhe teaches it as an Article of Faith, or not? But how can a Church be true, and yet not ſound nor ſecure, in this ſenſe alſo? A true Church muſt lead men to Salvation; and certainly it cannot lead men to Salvation, if it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns, and requires them to do things
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:102636:100"/>deſtructive thereunto. Wherefore I cannot ſee what Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is able to mean by a Sound and Secure Church; which does not prove, either that there is not in the world any Church True and Sound; or that there is no Church True which is not Sound, and ſecure: and we are ſo far from confounding a True Church with a Sound and Secure Church in the firſt ſenſe abovemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>i. e.</hi> with a Church free from all dangers and difficulties, as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will needs ſuppoſe we do, that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly affirm, that there is no True Church in the world, Sound and Secure in that ſenſe; according to what I ſet down in my Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 5. But the Dr. did not think fit to take notice thereof.</p>
               <p>From what has been agitated in the precedent Diſcourſes, it manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is guilty of Self Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, by aſſerting that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is a True Church, and yet char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her with Idolatry, yea the groſſeſt Idolatry of the world: and as I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the beginning, I am willing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, as Judges in this plea, the Learned men in our two famous Univerſities.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> The Doctor's Anſwer to my <hi>Appendix,</hi> proved Frivolous.</head>
               <p>I Come now to conſider, what Anſwer Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is pleaſed to afford to the <hi>Appendix</hi> of my Book; which he At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks in the next place: wherein, to confirm the former Doctrine, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Nullity of the Charge of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, caſt upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that either his Principles, whereon he bottoms the forementioned Charge, were not good, or that he himſelf was an Idolater: and the greateſt part of his Anſwer, being contained in leſs than three leaves in Octavo, is ſtuffed up with Scoffs, gawdy expreſſions, jingling Metaphors, ſuperfluous Digreſſions, Railery, and ſuch like Chaff, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Ingredients of his Books. After I had declared each premiſe by it ſelf, I ſummed up the ſubſtance of my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this manner.</p>
               <p>Whoever Worſhips God repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a way far inferiour to his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102636:101"/>is an Idolater, according to Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s main Principle; whereby he pretends to make good the Charge of Idolatry laid upon us in the Veneration of Images.</p>
               <p>But whoever Worſhips God repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto him without the Beatifical Viſion, either by Images, by words, or by Imagination, he worſhips God repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in a way far inferiour to his Greatneſs, as is manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore whoever Worſhips God, repreſented unto him without the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical Viſion, either by Words or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or by his own Imagination, as is ding to Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s Principles, is an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but Dr. <hi>St.</hi> does worſhip God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented unto him without the Beatifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Viſion, either by words, by Images, or his own Imaginations, as is evident, if he Worſhips God at all. Whence I conclude, that he is an Idolater, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own Conceſſions.</p>
               <p>Now Dr. <hi>St.</hi> cannot deny the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, if he once grants the Premiſes: neither can he deny the Premiſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eating his own words, or denying ſome manifeſt Principle. For, certainly he is not ſo wicked, as to confeſs that he never Worſhips God; nor ſo Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natically
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:102636:101"/>pround, as to ſay, That he does enjoy the Beatifical Viſion. Whence it follows, that he muſt grant, that he Worſhips God repreſented unto him in ſome manner beneath the Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Viſion. For it is certain, that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Repreſentations of God, different from the Beatifical Viſion, muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily fall beneath it. Hence I infer, that all Repreſentations of God, excepting the Beatifical Viſion, (which is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitive Knowledg of God) are inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to his Greatneſs. For all ſuch Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, as the Apoſtle teaches us, are <hi>Enigmatical,</hi> and <hi>per ſpeculum,</hi> not repreſenting God, on the part of the object, <hi>ſicuti eſt,</hi> as he is, but (as Scholaſtical Divines term them) <hi>inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate</hi> and <hi>abſtractive, per species alienas,</hi> by <hi>Idea's</hi> alien, and far eſtranged from the Nature of God; and conſequently, infinitely beneath his Greatneſs. For whatſoever is not God, muſt neceſſarily be infinitely beneath him. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Repreſentations of God not as he is, but by alien Species, and Idea's (ſuch are all Repreſentations of God by words, by Images, or by abſtractive, and imperfect Imaginations) are far
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102636:102"/>inferiour to his Greatneſs, and Majeſty; it is manifeſtly inferred, that whoever Worſhips God, repreſented unto him in either of the forementioned manners, muſt needs worſhip him repreſented in a way far inferiour to his Greatneſs. Neither does Dr. <hi>St.</hi> in his Anſwer to this point, any where refute this Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine; but rather confirms it, confeſſing plainly, <hi>pag.</hi> 39. <hi>That his Conceptions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach the Greatneſs of God;</hi> and he would be a Fanatick ſhould he aſſert rhe contrary. Now ſince Dr. <hi>St.</hi> worſhips God repreſented unto him by his own Conceptions, theſe remaining far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath his Greatneſs, we conclud that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> worſhips God repreſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in a way inferiour to his Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, and Majeſty. Wherefore, to ſave himſelf from being an Idolater, he muſt neceſſarily deny this Principle to be true, <hi>viz. Whoever worſhips God, repreſented unto him in a way inferiour to his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is an Idolater.</hi> Yet this is the main Principle, whereon he grounds the Charge of Idolatry, caſt upon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, in the Veneration of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: and hence is manifeſtly proved,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:102636:102"/>that the aforeſaid Charge, as bottomed upon a falſe and Sandy Principle, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together groundleſs, and frivolous: which was what I intended by this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix, made in confirmation of what I had laid down before, to prove our Church guitleſs of Idolatry.</p>
               <p>Let's now examin, what Artifices the Dr. uſes, to clear himſelf from this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Idolatry, drawn up againſt him out of his own Principles, and to <hi>prevent the Train</hi> (as he ſaies <hi>pag.</hi> 35.) <hi>laid to blow him up, fetch'd from his own Stores.</hi> Firſt, he ſeems to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to ſuſpect, that this Charge of Idolatry caſt upon him, <hi>was intended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a piece of Drollery.</hi> This is a pretty way to ſtave off all Arguments <hi>ab abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do;</hi> which are very concluding, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent among Learned men; when to prove the inanity of ſome Principle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Adverſary, they lay open the abſurdities which thence enſue. A compendious Anſwering to all ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, according to this incomparable Doctors way of anſwering, is to tell thoſe who frame them, <hi>That they are in jeſt,</hi> and that <hi>without doubt they intend
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:102636:103"/>only to Droll.</hi> But if this manner of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering be warrantable, 'twill be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to tell Dr. <hi>St.</hi> That his whole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe of Idolatry, and Fanaticiſm, charged upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and almoſt all his other works, were inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only for pieces of Drollery. Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Quality, and no <hi>Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> could find no fitter place in his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary for Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s Diſcourſe of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Idolatry, than to put it among the Play-books.</p>
               <p>After this, to annul the aforeſaid Charge of Idolatry, he betakes himſelf to admiration. <hi>What,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>pag.</hi> 35. <hi>is it come to this at laſt?</hi> and <hi>am I become an Idolater too, who was never apt to think my ſelf inclined ſo much as to Superſtition?</hi> I marry Sir, This is a ſpeedy way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to diſpatch Arguments, with no more than an Admiration. What! Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> and Idolater? Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,</hi> that Zealous man for Religion? who knows not how to defend his own Church to be True, without laying down Principles, that prove all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, never ſo Heretical, or Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, to be true, and Orthodox. Dr.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102636:103"/>
                  <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> that pious and godly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant! who has ſo great a kindneſs for the Proteſtant Church, that he makes her the very ſame with an Idolatrous Church, and with ſuch a kind of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, that is worſe <hi>than the adoring a red Cloath for God!</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> ſo Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious a man, that by all we can gueſs by his Principles alledged above, we cannot determin, whether he be of any, or of no Religion! What, ſuch a man as this, an Idolater! no, God forbid. And why? Becauſe (forſooth) <hi>he was never apt to think himſelf inclined that way.</hi> Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent! juſt as if one ſhould ſay, The Heathens did not think themſelves Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, nor inclined that way: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were no Idolaters. I wonder; why Dr. <hi>St.</hi> who boaſts ſo much of his Charity, does not go to <hi>Newgate</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Malefactors there, how they may defend themſelves, when they are Arraigned for Thieves, or Murderers; telling them with one ſole Exclamation, they may invalidate all the Evidences brought in againſt them. <hi>What, They, Thieves? They, Murderers? They, take away mens Goods, and Lives too? who
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:102636:104"/>were never apt to think themſelves inclined but to works of Piety?</hi> and as coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by ſo good an Advocate, they would, doubtleſs, be inſtantly diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <p>But if this be the Champion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, as he is cryed up to be, ſhe is in as miſerable a condition, any of her Enemies con wiſh her. Such Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as theſe, have brought the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtancy ſo low, that 'tis no wonder they ſhould in a every Seſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment give her a Cordial to keep her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. Such Miniſters contribute far more to the ruine of Proteſtancy, than any <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſts. Yea, if this manner of anſwering be ſolid, it follows alſo, that the Charges of Idolatry, and Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme, wherewith he impeaches our Church, are without difficulty repealed, ſaying only, <hi>What, The Church of Rome Idolatrous! That Church, which has ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Paganiſme from the greateſt part of the World! Should ſhe introduce an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry more deteſtable, than the groſſeſt Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of the Pagans! That Church, which even Proteſtants themſelves confeſs, to have been the only viſible Church of Chriſt,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:102636:104"/>for above</hi> 1000 <hi>years, and acknowledge her to be the Mother Church, the Patriarchal Church of the Weſt, the firſt See,</hi> prima Sedes, <hi>a true Member at leaſt of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, unerring in all Articles of Faith, the very ſame with their own Church; from whom they pretend to derive the Ordination of their Biſhops, and by whom have been handed down to them the Books of Scripture; upon which alone they ground their Religion: that ſuch a Church, and acknowledged as ſuch, ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached by Proteſtants, and among the reſt by Dr.</hi> St. <hi>who in moſt things agrees to the former Character given of her: Should, I ſay, be impeached of an Iddolatry more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable, than the Adoration of an Animal, a Statue, or a red Cloth, for God; is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a thing worthy of Admiration, and whereof ſeveral moderate Proteſtants are aſhamed.</hi> But why ſhould any one won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> (Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi> I ſay) ſhould be an Idolater; and only becauſe <hi>he was never apt to think himſelf inclined that way?</hi> Although I never abſolutely accuſed him of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but only on ſuppoſition, that the Principles whereon he pretends to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:102636:105"/>eſtabliſh the Charge of Idolatry caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, were warrantable: which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different, as preſently ſhall be made to appear.</p>
               <p>He goes on, and ſaies (<hi>pag.</hi> 53.) <hi>That all the comfort he found left, was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the concluſion of my Book;</hi> wherein, as he affirms, I confeſs, <hi>That the ſame Argument proves the Prophets, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and the Holy Ghost himſelf, to be I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters:</hi> and then he adds, <hi>that he hoped there was no great harm to be feared in ſo good Company.</hi> But Dr. <hi>St.</hi> very diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuoſly leaves out this Clauſe contained in my Book, <hi>viz. or it proves nothing:</hi> which renders the ſenſe very different fcom what thoſe words, as quoted by the Dr. may ſeem to import. For ſure he will not deny, but that it is a very different thing to ſay abſolutely, Dr. <hi>St. is an Hypocrite,</hi> without adding any thing more, or to ſay, Dr. <hi>St. is an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, if he holds one Religion in his heart, and profeſſes another exteriourly.</hi> Now my intent was, by diſcovering the vaſt abſurdities, which wait upon Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s Argument, whereby he pretends to prove <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks guilty of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:102636:105"/>to ſhew the inanity, and nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, according to that irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Maxime of <hi>Rational Diſcourſes, Out of Truth alone neither Falſity, nor Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity does follow:</hi> and becauſe perhaps ſome might not think it any abſurdity to grant, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is an Idolater; and conſequently, admitting it, might ſtick to his Argument, I added, <hi>that the ſame Argument of the Dr. had it any force in it, would prove the Evangeliſts, and the Holy Ghoſt to be Idolaters:</hi> an abſurdity ſo great, that no Chriſtian can aſſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: and when we argue <hi>ab abſurdo,</hi> the greater, and more evident the abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we infer, is, the better is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. So that my Diſcourſe runs thus:</p>
               <p>Either Dr. <hi>St.'s</hi> Argument proves the Evangeliſts, and Holy Ghoſt, to be Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, or it proves nothing; as I have ſhewen throughout that Appendix.</p>
               <p>But it does not, nor cannot prove, the Evangeliſts, and the Holy Ghoſt to be Idolaters. For certainly there can be no good proof of a Falſity, or Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</p>
               <p>Therefore his Argument proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:102636:106"/>
               <p>When ſhall we find any thing in the Dr. that looks like a rational Anſwer to this Charge of Idolatry, which lies ſo heavy upon him, out of his own Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets? He ſaies (<hi>pag.</hi> 37.) <hi>That God did forbid, in the Commandment, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of him by Images; but not the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of him by our Conceptions,</hi> although <hi>unſuitable to his incomprehenſible nature;</hi> without taking any notice of what I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the contrary: for <hi>pag.</hi> 19. I affirmed, that the Dr. himſelf, <hi>pag.</hi> 59. in his Diſcourſe concerning the <hi>Roman</hi> Idolatry, did underſtand the prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contained in the Commandment, of <hi>all kind of Similitudes, or Repreſentations whatſoever, whether of a real, or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Being.</hi> For the words of the Law being general, all ſorts of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Likeneſſes of God are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily comprehended therein. Now, not only Corporeal Images, but alſo Words and Conceptions, are certain Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and Reſemblances of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> never denied. Yea Knowledge, or Mental Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is commonly defined a Formal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of an Object; and it is an
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:102636:106"/>ordinary opinion among Philoſophers, that in obſcure, and abſtract Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the mind frames an Idea of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And certainly ſhould one adore his own thoughts, and Idea's, he would commit Idolatry, and tranſgreſs this Commandment. Wherefore this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment does forbid the making any Image, or Repreſentation of God, whether Spiritual, or Corporeal; not abſolutely; but as the Law ſaies, to adore it. Since therefore, as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes in his former book, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons now alledged do evince, the Law ſpeaks of all kinds of Repreſentations, and Reſemblances, in order to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, why does he, in his Anſwer to my Book, confine the Law only to Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Repreſentations?</p>
               <p>Again, if according to the Dictates of Nature, (as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> affirms. <hi>pag.</hi> 36. who therefore thinks this command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be of an unalterable Nature, common to all, and not peculiar to the Jews) 'tis Idolatry to repreſent God by Corporeal Images, or to adore him ſo repreſented; becauſe Corporeal things repreſent God in a way far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:102636:107"/>his Greatneſs, (which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he produces for the Law) it follows evidently, that whoever adores God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented unto him in a way beneath his Greatneſs, whether by words, Images, or groſs Imaginations; (for neither of theſe waies do repreſent him in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſuitable to his Majeſty, and there are unworthy Conceptions of God, as well as unworthy Images) is an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: which is, what I intended to prove againſt him. For in natural Precepts (ſuch as this is) the Law extends as far as the Reaſon of the Law; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the conſtant Axiome of Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>Cauſalis vera infert univerſalem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram.</hi> If the Propoſition, which contains the cauſe, or reaſon of a thing be true, there follows neceſſarily an univerſal Truth. Wherefore if this Propoſition, who adores God repreſented by Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real things is an Idolater, becauſe he adores him repreſented in a way inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to his Greatneſs, be true, as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will needs have it to be, this Univerſal muſt alſo be true, <hi>Whoever adores God, repreſented in a way inferiour to his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is an Idolater.</hi> But the Dr. thought
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:102636:107"/>it beſt not to take any notice at all of theſe things: and I find, that among many other his rare accompliſhments, one is, that he is excellent in forgetting ſuch things, as he knows he cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>In the ſame page he will ſeem to lay in the duſt my whole Diſcourſe, with theſe only words: <hi>But the miſchief is, all this ſubtlety</hi> (of my Argument) <hi>is uſed againſt the Law-maker, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me.</hi> O Irrefragable Anſwer! if ſuch Anſwers as theſe wll ſerve the turn, I'le warrant you the Dr. will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be puzzled. Let any one interpret the Law of God never ſo ridiculouſly, if he be urged with the Abſurdities, that flow from ſuch an Interpretation, his anſwer may be according to this learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dr. when he hath nothing elſe to ſay, That <hi>all the Abſurdities they pretend to draw from his Interpretation, are againſt the Law-maker, and not againſt him.</hi> Here occurs unto me, what I have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read in a brief account of the moſt material paſſages between the Quakers and the Baptiſts, at the <hi>Barbican</hi> Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>London, October</hi> 9. 1674. <hi>pag.</hi> 9,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:102636:108"/>10. <hi>The Anabaptiſt preſs'd the Quaker in this manner: the Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> Let Women be ſilent in the Church. <hi>Why ſuffer ye Women to declare? The Quaker anſwered, The Woman to be ſilenced, is</hi> the Fleſh. <hi>Has the Fleſh, replies the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptist, a Husband? Yea, ſaies the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: and who is it, replyed again the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt. the Quaker promptly anſwered,</hi> The Devil. <hi>But the Anabaptiſt goes on, and urges, The Text ſaith,</hi> Let a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ask her Husband at home; <hi>muſt the Fleſh be inſtructed by the Devil in matters of Religion?</hi> Here the poor Quaker ſeemed, according to this account, to be puzzled. But had Dr. <hi>St.</hi> been by him, he would have ſuggeſted to him this eaſie anſwer. <hi>Alas for thee! Thou canſt not underſtand. All thy ſubtlety is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Paul, <hi>and not against me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The debate between us and Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is concerning the right meaning of Gods Commandment. The Dr. ſaies, that thereby are prohibited <hi>all Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, in a way inferiour to his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Adoring of him ſo Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> And after I had ſhewn out of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Principles the abſurdity of this
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:102636:108"/>interpretation, can the Dr. think it a ſufficient anſwer to ſay, <hi>All this ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is againſt the Law maker, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him?</hi> Whenas all the Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I deduce, are againſt Dr. <hi>St.'s</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Law, not againſt the Law it ſelf, nor the Law-maker.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>pag.</hi> 38. he ſeems to place the difference between Thoughts of God, and Corporeal Images of him, in order to our preſent deſign, That the former proceeds from the neceſſary weakneſs of our underſtanding, not being able to reach the Greatneſs of God; who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore has procured by ſeveral waies, to prevent the errour of our Imaginations. But the latter are voluntary. This diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or diſparity, is very inſignificant. For, as it proceeds from the neceſſary weakneſs of a mans underſtanding, that we cannot repreſent God in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and Imaginations, but in a way far beneath his Greatneſs: ſo it proceeds alſo from the neceſſary weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all humane Art, and Learning, that we cannot repreſent him either by Words, or Corporeal Images, but in a manner very unſuitable to his Majeſty.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:102636:109"/>And as I have inſinuated ſeveral times, 'tis certain, that there are as unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and unworthy Repreſentations of God, and as far beneath his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in Imaginations, and in words, as in Corporeal Images. For what are Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or Pictures, as I hinted <hi>pag.</hi> 20. but mens conceptions, and Idea's either cut out in Stone, or ſet down in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours? And as God does procure to prevent the Errours of our Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons relating to him, by ſecuring us, that he is far greater, than we can imagin; ſo he does procure in like manner, to prevent the Errours in our Words, and Images concerning God, by ſecuring us, that he is far greater, than he can be expreſt, either by Words, or Images.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if the Dr. underſtands, (for neither he himſelf ſeems to know what he would be at) by the difference aſſigned here by him, that we may chuſe whether we will make Corporeal Images of God, or not; but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe but think of God; and by conſequence, Thoughts of God are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: but Corporeal Images of God are voluntary; Then I reply, that this
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:102636:109"/>diſparity dos not ſolve the difficulty, concerning the expreſſion, or repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of God in words; which is as voluntary unto us, as the repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of him in Images. And yet Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will not ſay, either that we cannot ſpeak of God without committing Idolatry; or that we are able to expreſs in words his ineffable Majeſty, as it deſerves to be expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Again many times to think of God is, in ſome manner, free unto us; becauſe it is free unto us, whether we will hear Sermons, read Books, and recite Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, wherein ſeveral expreſſions of God are contained; and conſequently they excite in us Thoughts of God, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by them. And although the firſt Thought of God be not free unto us, yet the continuation thereof is ſo: nay ſometimes Corporeal Pictures of God occur unto us, when by chance we light upon them, without more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome on our part, then the Thoughts of God: ſo that were there no other diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than what the Dr. here hints at, 'twould in that caſe be no leſs Idolatry to adore God repreſented by our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:102636:110"/>than by Corporeal Images.</p>
               <p>Another diſparity he inſinuates, is, <hi>That our Conceptions, although they reach not the Greatneſs of God, yet they are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Repreſentations of his Nature; but Images are Corporeal Reſemblances; and it is a great diſparagement to God, to bring him down to the meanneſs of a Corporeal Image.</hi> This anſwer is alſo very frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Firſt, becauſe words are Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Repreſentations; yet it is no Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to adore God as repreſented unto us in the words of Scripture. Neither will Dr. <hi>St.</hi> dare to affirm the contrary, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by ſuch words, God be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto us in the ſame, or like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as he is repreſented in a Picture, <hi>viz.</hi> with Hands, Arms, Mouth, Sitting, and with ſuch like Corporeal Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Secondly, becauſe, ſince our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions do not reach the Greatneſs of God, we cannot think of God without abaſing him, and bringing him down to the Meanneſs of our thoughts. Seeing therefore, that according to Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s Sentiment, it is Idolatry to repreſent God by Corporeal Images, becauſe they cannot reach his Greatneſs, but
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:102636:110"/>neceſſarily bring him down to mean Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; upon the ſame account it would be Idolatry to repreſent him by our Conceptions; and the difference, if any, would only be, that the former is ſomewhat groſſer, than the latter. Thirdly, to adore as God any Creature, whether Spiritual, as an Angel, or the Devil, or Corporeal, as an Animal or Statue, is flat Idolatry; neither the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Spiritual, or Corporeal, can ſave the one from being Idolatry, and not the other: and it would be very abſurd to ſay, that to adore the Devil as God is not Idolatry, becauſe the Divil is a Spirit; but to adore the Sun, as God, is Idolatry, becauſe the Sun is a Body. Wherefore in the like manner there can be no reaſon to affirm, that the Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God by our Conceptions is not Idolatry; but that the Adoration of God by Images is, becauſe theſe are Corporeal, but thoſe are Spiritual.</p>
               <p>Finally he anſwers, <hi>pag.</hi> 38. That he had never ſuch an <hi>Imagination</hi> of God, as to <hi>apprehend him like an old man ſitting in Heaven;</hi> that he has no other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of God; <hi>but of a Being infinitely
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:102636:111"/>perfect.</hi> But with the Dr.'s leave, unleſs he enjoyes the Beatifical Viſion of God, &amp; ſees God face to face, <hi>(facie ad faciem)</hi> which we have no reaſon to believe he does, the Knowledge, and Conception, he frames of God, muſt neceſſarily be Enigmatical, as the Scripture terms it, and Abſtractive; and conſequently by the Species, and Similitude of Things far eſtranged from God: whether of <hi>an old man ſitting in Heaven,</hi> or of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther object it matters little: Becauſe whatever is not God, is infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath him. Beſides, when Dr. <hi>St.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites his Creed, with attention to what the words ſignifie, he muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive God by the Species, or Similitude of one, who has a right hand, when he pronounces thoſe words, <hi>Sedet ad dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teram Dei Patris Omnipotentis,</hi> and it is an intolerable arrogance in Dr. <hi>St.</hi> to ſcorn, as it ſeems he does, to conceive God, as he is repreſented unto us in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places of Scripture, under Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Similitudes; and as the Prophets themſelves, who writ thoſe Books, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him: their words being expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Thoughts and Conceptions.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:102636:111"/>
               <p>Moreover, I deſire to know from Dr. <hi>St.</hi> whether he ever lifts up his heart, and Adores Chriſt, as he conceives him in Heaven, or not. If not, 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he ſhould not dare to Adore Chriſt in the Euchariſt for fear of committing Idolatry; whenas upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he dares not Adore him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. If ſo, can the Dr. imagin, that he conceives Chriſt in Heaven, as really he is there, with that Glory, Majeſty, and Beauty, which neither <hi>eye has ſeen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man has been able to comprehend?</hi> Is not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception he has of Chriſt in Heaven, like to ſome Pictures we have of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in Glory; which are only fancies of the Painter? And if he cannot conceive the Humanity of our Saviour, as he is in Heaven, much leſs his Divinity. Wherefore he muſt Adore Chriſt in Heaven, if ever he Adores him, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in a manner far beneath his Greatneſs.</p>
               <p>Neither do we deny God to be a Being infinitely Perfect: which is the notion of God. Yet this does not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that ſuch an Infinite Being may
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:102636:112"/>be conceived by men under the Species, or Similitude, of ſome Corporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: as we all confeſs, that an Angel is a meer Spiritual ſubſtance; yet we conceive, and paint an Angel under the Species of a young man with wings on his ſhoulders; when as in reality ſuch a man is neither an Angel, nor has any Phyſical likeneſs, unleſs it be very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, with him. Yet ſuch a Picture, or Idea, is commonly taken to ſignifie an Angel.</p>
               <p>And here 'tis neceſſary to advertiſe, what Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will not ſeem to reflect on, That it is a very different thing, to take ſuch a Statute, Picture, Enigma, or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme, to ſignifie ſuch an object, and to take ſuch a Statue, Picture, Enigma, or Embleme, to be the very object it ſelf, or very like thereunto. In the City of <hi>London</hi> are put up three Statues of Women, with ſuch Attirement, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Faith, Hope, and Charity; with whom they have no likeneſs at all: ſo that thoſe Statues are taken by the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens to ſignifie thoſe Vertues, and to put them in mind of them. But ſure Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will not ſay, that the Citizens of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:102636:112"/>
                  <hi>London</hi> are ſo ſilly, as to take Faith, Hope, and Charity, to be really three Women in ſuch a Dreſs; or that they have any real likeneſs, unleſs very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, with them. The ſame is to be ſeen in all Emblems, and Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks; which are taken to ſignifie things very different. So a Ring is an Emblem of Eternity: But who does think that Eternity is a Ring?</p>
               <p>In the like manner to take God to be really <hi>an old man ſitting in Heaven,</hi> with Hands, Arms, Mouth and Feet, or to have a great likeneſs with him, would, beyond queſtion be very diſhonourable unto God, and unworthy of him; but to take the Idea, or Picture of an <hi>Old man ſitting in Heaven (Antiquus Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum)</hi> as God is deſcribed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) or ſome other Corporeal Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick, contained in the Apocalypſe, or other places of Scripture, to ſignifie, and repreſent unto us God, a <hi>Being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Perfect,</hi> is by no means diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, or injurious unto him: otherwiſe the Prophets and Evangeliſts would be to blame for repreſenting him under ſuch Idea's or Expreſſions. Neither are
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:102636:113"/>the Pictures of God more obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the miſtakes of vulgar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then the like expreſſions by words, contained in the Creed and Scripture, as I inſinuated in my Book. But the Dr. thought good to paſs it over. Wherefore if Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has a more ſubtilized manner of conceiving the Divine Eſſence, than the Prophets, and Apoſtles had, he may keep it to himſelf: we, poor men, ſhall content our ſelves to conceive God as the Apoſtles and Prophets repreſent him in the Creed and Scripture.</p>
               <p>From what hitherto has been diſcuſt, in relation to this point, it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that either Dr. <hi>St.</hi> muſt grant himſelf; and if that be not abſurdity great enough, the Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, and the Holy Ghoſt, to be Idolaters; or confeſs, that the main Principle, whereon he pretends to make good the Charge of Idolatry, laid upon us in the Veneration of Images; to be frivolous, and inſignificant: which is what we aim at. But ſuch is the obſtinacy of ſome men, that to maintain one folly, they will run into a thouſand; and they will be ſure to do their work, whatever
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:102636:113"/>comes of it. Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſeems to be ſo Complaiſant, that to the end we may be Idolaters, he is willing to bear us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and to be an Idolater himſelf, and to bring with him too the Prophets and Evangeliſts: and <hi>what harm is there to be feared in ſo good Company?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, the way he takes to prove us guilty of Idolatry in the Veneration of Images either is a meer dream, or it ſhews, there is <hi>no Church in the world,</hi> though never ſo Orthodox, Pure, and Sound, which does not require Idolatry. For all Churches require, that we ſhould adore God, and as <hi>repreſented to us in this life.</hi> Since therefore, according to the ordinary Providence, we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent God in this life, <hi>as he is,</hi> but in a manner <hi>far inferiour to his Greatneſs,</hi> it follows manifeſtly, that all Churches, and all Religions, though never ſo Pure, and Sound, require, we ſhould Adore God, repreſented unto us, in a way <hi>far inferiour to his Majeſty:</hi> which according to Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is flat Idolatry. So that the Dr. to be ſure to perſwade his Devotes to be no <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> he perſwades them to be of no Religion; or, which
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:102636:114"/>is the ſame, deters them from that, which is <hi>Eſſential to all Religions;</hi> as is the Adoration of God, repreſented in a manner <hi>inferiour to his Greatneſs:</hi> and as to prove <hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi> Idolaters in the Veneration of God by Images, he proves himſelf, the Prophets, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts; and all perſons whatſoever, that profeſs any Religion, to be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Idolaters; ſo to ſhew us guilty of the ſame Crime in the Adoration of the Euchariſt, (which is the groſſeſt Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try he Fathers upon us) he muſt declare as Complices, the Lutherans, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> and Adore Chriſt in the Euchariſt, as we do: and what good Reformers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church were the Lutherans, (and yet as ſuch they are look'd upon by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants) if they left her depraved with a more deteſtable ſort of Idolatry, in the Dr.'s perſwaſion, than is the <hi>Adoring of a Red Cloath for God.</hi> But ſuch is Dr. <hi>St.'s</hi> Zeal. So that <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> be Idolaters, whoever elſe be ſo, he cares not. Friends or Foes, 'tis all one to him. It is to affront the Dr. to imagin, that a man of his Employments has leiſure,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:102636:114"/>to conſider the vaſt abſurdities, that flow from what he maintains.</p>
               <p>And, to uſe the ſame words I ſet down in the Appendix, <hi>pag.</hi> 21. I infer, and conclude hence, <hi>how little account is to be made of the Charge of Idolatry laid upon the</hi> Roman <hi>Church by Dr.</hi> St. <hi>ſeeing that the very ſame Principles, whereby he pretends to prove, that</hi> Roman-Catholicks <hi>are Idolaters, do prove, or they prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, (as is moſt certain: for an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that proves too much, proves nothing) that the Prophets, the Evangeliſts, and the Holy Ghoſt, are Idolaters. And if in this main point of Idolatry, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make manifest, and undeniable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, he does err ſo Sacrilegiouſly, and ſo Enormouſly, may we not prudently think that the other Charges, of leſser moment, which he laies upon the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, and wherein he does not pretend to ſo great an Evidence, are meer Whimſies, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Calumnies?</hi>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Concerning the other Contradictions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Dr. in the Charges he laies upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</head>
               <p>MY deſign at the beginning was, to purſue in particular the other Contradictions, wherewith I charge the Dr, But what hitherto has been ſet down is ſufficient, Firſt, becauſe I have manifeſtly convicted him of Self-contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, in aſſerting the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be a True Church, and yet Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, with the groſſeſt Idolatry: and ſince the main aſperſion the caſts upon us is this of Idolatry, (which therefore he terms the <hi>Mouth of the Dragon</hi>) if he can clear himſelf from Self-Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this point, we are willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him free from that imputation in the other points, mentioned in my Book.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe we have ſeen, That the Dr. does confeſſedly grant the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be a True way to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:102636:115"/>Heaven, a True Church, unerring in all Articles of Faith: and hence follows (as already we have evidenced) that ſhe teaches nothing as an Article of Faith, which is either a Falſity, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: and that ſhe neither requires, nor approves of any thing deſtructive to Salvation. And yet after all this, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> maintains, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church teaches, and requires Damnable Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and groſs Violations of Gods laws: which doubtleſs are deſtructive to Salvation: and herein, according to his Aſperſion, conſiſts the danger of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in living and dying in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: That ſhe teaches and allows of particular En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſms, contrary to the Law of God, and countenances Rebellion, contrary to the Duty, due to Lawful Superiours; which Duty is an Article of Divine Faith. And herein he conſtitutes the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Fanaticiſme of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: and finally that ſhe teaches and countenances Diviſions in matters of Faith: which ſhe cannot do without countenancing Hereſies, and Errours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Articles of Faith. Whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:102636:116"/>that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> palpably contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himſelf, by granting the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be a True Church, and yet charging her with danger of Salvation in her Communion, Fanaticiſme, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions in matters of Faith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe one notorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction being evidenced againſt any perſon, is enough to overthrow all his authority, and credit, and to vacate, conſequently all the Arguments which depend upon his Authority, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, as the Dr. himſelf confeſſes. Since therefore Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſtands convicted of a palpable Self contradiction in a matter of ſo great a moment, as is the Charge of Idolatry layed to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and ſince the other Charges above mentioned depend upon his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and faithfulneſs in the Quotations he produces out of our Authors, and whereon he grounds ſuch Charges, we infer, that the aforeſaid Charges are Null, till he has wiped off the Self-contradiction, whereof he is Convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or at leaſt till thoſe, who peruſe his Books, have found out, that his Quotations are faithful, and effectual to his purpoſe.</p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:102636:116"/>
               <p>I have read not long ſince, in the <hi>Catholick Apology</hi> (Third Edition) the Right Honourable Author whereof has handled all matters of Fact objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, ſo accurately, and perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, that whoever is not reſolved to be obſtinate, cannot but remain ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: I have read (I ſay) in that ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 269. <hi>What</hi> Gonda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour <hi>obſerved in one of his Letters to</hi> Olivarez. <hi>He ſaies, that being out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity once with King</hi> James <hi>at Chappel, he perceived the Auditory extreamly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to their Miniſter; yet nevertheleſs they would not (he found) truſt him a whit. For no ſooner had be cited a place of Scripture, but they all ran to their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, to ſee whether it were ſo, or not.</hi> Now if Proteſtants will not truſt their Miniſters, and are taught even by the Miniſters themſelves, not to truſt them, when they quote, or rather read places out of their Bible which they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; citing the Book, the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Verſe; and when every one, or at leaſt the greateſt part of the Auditory, have their Bible with them; ſo that if the Miniſter ſhould forge any
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:102636:117"/>thing, or be miſtaken in the leaſt kind, his forgery, or miſtake would preſently be diſcovered, to his Eternal diſgrace, for forging, or miſtaking, Gods own word, and not the word of men. If, I ſay, even in theſe Circumſtances, where there is ſo little reaſon to ſuſpect any forgerie, or miſtake, they are taught not to truſt their own Miniſters, why ſhould they truſt them in the Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the <hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi> till themſelves have found out, that what they alledge againſt us, is, as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? when many times the Miniſter does not ſo much as name the Author for the thing he quotes; or names the Author, but not the Book, or the page; when he has not the Author before him, nor (perchance) has ever ſeen him: but what he quotes, he has received at a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third hand; or if he has ſeen him, it has been only perfunctoriouſly; or a long time ſince, and ſo he may have forgotten the words; when none of the Auditory have the Book with them; nor (in any times) know where to find it; nor, if they find it (perhaps) moſt of them do not underſtand the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:102636:117"/>Language, wherein it is written; ſo that the forgery, or miſtake, if there be any, is not eaſily detected; and at moſt is a forgery, or miſtake, in the word of man, not of God? ſhould the Proteſtants ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve only this rule, (which they are taught by their own Miniſters) even in Circumſtances, where there is ſuſpicion of ſome forgery or miſtake, <hi>viz.</hi> not to truſt them, but to ſuſpend their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till they have conſulted the books themſelves, and find, that what their Miniſters alledge, is true; moſt of the Calumnies urged againſt us, would va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh to nothing: and if this is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved with other Miniſters, even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own Doctrine, much more with Dr. <hi>St.</hi> who by ſtanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of Self-contradiction has forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all his Authority, and Credit.</p>
               <p>The Dr. ſeems very fond of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe concerning the Fanaticiſme of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; wherefore 'twill not be amiſs to add ſomething in particular, in reference to this point. He ſaies, <hi>pag.</hi> 51. That to prove, that Fanaticiſme does neceſſarily contain a Reſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Authority, I unhappily quote
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:102636:118"/>theſe his words, <hi>p.</hi> 141. in his Diſcourſe concerning the Fanaticiſme of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church; <hi>By Fanaticiſme we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand either an Enthuſiaſtick way of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or reſiſting Authority, under pretence of Religion.</hi> Now I thought, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> in the forementioned words had given us two different Notions, or Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of Fanaticiſme; but I was miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. For the Dr. as it ſeems, intended only in that place to aſſign two ſorts of Fanaticiſme. The reaſon of my miſtake was, becauſe I ſuppoſed, that the Dr. proceeded like a Scholar, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, beginning to treat of Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſme, he would give us ſome Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. But he very illogically tells us, how many ſorts of Fanaticiſme there are, without ever telling us what it is. I hope, he will pardon this miſtake; and I promiſe never more to be miſtaken in him upon that account; nor ever to ſuppoſe, that he proceeds like a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
               <p>Neither does this miſtake of mine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the truth of the abovementioned Propoſition, layed down by me; which I proved from the common perſwaſion of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:102636:118"/>Mankind. For no body judges that to be Fanaticiſm, which is not grounded upon a private Spirit, and Judgment, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Authority. Neither does, nor can the Dr. deny it. Hence I inferred, that the very conſtitution of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which we both ſuppoſe to be a True Church) is deſtructive to Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſme; becauſe ſhe does not leave eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to be guided by his private Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Judgment, in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and in the Interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but obliges all to ſubmit to her judgment, as is manifeſt: neither can the Dr. queſtion it; ſince he oftentimes complains of the Tyranny (as he is pleaſed to term it) of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in this point. See <hi>Doctor Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet againſt Doctor Stillingfleet, pag.</hi> 10. all which he paſſes over in ſilence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 52. the Dr. wonders, why I do not ſpeak a word of the Fanatick Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Rebellion owned, as he will needs have it, by the Jeſuitical party, <hi>viz. The King's deriving his power from the people, and the people's Authority to call the King to account, and if they ſee
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:102636:119"/>good, to take away his Power, and to chang the Government: and not only ſo, but to take away his Life too:</hi> which peſtilent Principles he had quoted out of <hi>Mariana,</hi> a Jeſuit: and to ſhew, that not only the Jeſuits, but alſo the <hi>Roman</hi> Church does approve theſe Principles, (which was his main task) he adds, that <hi>the party, which owns theſe Principles</hi> [Jeſuits] <hi>is to this day the moſt countenanced, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged at Rome.</hi> So that he not only Fathers the forementioned Principles upon the whole Body of the Jeſuits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were delivered by one of their Community; but alſo upon <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe it favours the Jeſuits: which Argument of the Dr's. is as concluſive, as if you ſhould Argue thus; <hi>Hugh Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> a Member of the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> preached in the late Wars Rebellious Principles; Therefore not only the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> but his Majeſty alſo, who hath ſhewen a a particular kindneſs for that Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, do countenance ſuch Principles. Who would not contemn ſuch a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? And yet the Univerſity of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> has not made a more publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:102636:119"/>of thoſe Rebellious Principles of <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> than the Body of the Jeſuits has made of the forementioned Doctrines of <hi>Mariana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, the Pope, even in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of Proteſtants, is a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Temporal Prince of <hi>Rome,</hi> and its adjacent Territories, and as zealous (or more, if we believe Proteſtants) of his civil Authority, as ony other Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Prince whatſoever, how then is it credible, that he ſhould countenance ſo much the Jeſuits, as the Dr. ſaies he does; if they did allow ſuch Rebellious Principles, deſtructive to the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Temporal Princes? Moreover, that party Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſpeaks of, is counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by ſeveral Kings; who would be loth to be deprived of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. But alas for them! poor Princes, they do not underſtand the Intrigues of the Jeſuits, though they converſe often with them: neither have they men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, able to diſcover ſuch perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Doctrines. King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> his Majeſties Grandfather, and the preſent <hi>French</hi> King, (both fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers of the Jeſuits) are unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:102636:120"/>with matters of State, and Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: but Dr. <hi>Edward Stillingfleet,</hi> the great Polititian of the world, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends clearly the true intereſt of Princes; and though he has ſcarſe ever had any converſe with Jeſuits, yet with the ſublety of his private Spirit, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is able to diſcover in a moment, what Scriptures are Canonical, and which is their legitimate ſenſe) he has learned their Intrigues, and peſtilent Principles. Finally, thoſe, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the temper of <hi>Rome</hi> better than Dr. <hi>St.</hi> affirm, that the Dominicans, and Clergy, are as much (or more) counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced there, than Jeſuits: and yet the Dominicans and Clergy, if we believe Dr. <hi>St.</hi> are no great friends to Jeſuits.</p>
               <p>In the ſame page he ſaies, That <hi>if</hi> J. W. <hi>anſwer again, let him ſpeak out like a man, concerning thoſe Rebellious Principles</hi> abovementioned. Well then, <hi>J. W.</hi> ſpeaks out like a man, and tells the Dr. plainly, That he would be very ſorry, were he not perſwaded, that he detected the aforeſaid Principles more, than the Dr. himſelf does; for all that he can gather from his works. For,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:102636:120"/>whatever Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s practices have been, which <hi>J. W.</hi> has not yet made it his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to enquire after; yet even thoſe very Principles, whereby he pretends to clear the Proteſtant Church from the Crime of Sciſme, do vindicate, had they any force in them, all Rebellions, and Treacherous Conſpiracies, though never ſo execrable; and are moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to all Civil Government, than any Doctrines of <hi>Mariana,</hi> as will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly appear, to whoever ſhall take pains to compare them: And, to apply the Dr.'s own words to himſelf, in his Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Creſſy</hi>'s Apologetical Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>p.</hi> 475. <hi>He that owns the Principles that lead to him Treaſon, wants only an opportunity to act them.</hi> So that if Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has a juſt, and real zeal for his Majeſties Intereſt and Security, according to what he affirms (<hi>pag.</hi> 52.) his Principles do not lead him unto it, but the proſpect of ſome advantage thereby.</p>
               <p>I proved the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be free from Fanaticiſme, becauſe all Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme, as I ſhewed, or at leaſt that ſort of Fanaticiſme, which maintaines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Principles, <hi>is againſt all Lawful
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:102636:121"/>and competent Authority;</hi> as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt needs confeſs. Now what is countenanced by a competent, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful authority, is not againſt all ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as is manifeſt; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, cannot be Fanaticiſme, at leaſt that ſort of Fanaticiſme, that maintains re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Principles. Since therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is a True Church, uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in all Articles of Faith, and ſince the Authority of a True Church, is a lawful Authority, and ſufficient to clear particular waies of proceeding from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticiſme, as with ſeveral inſtances I have ſhewen (<hi>pag.</hi> 9.) in the proof of my fourth Propoſition, though the Dr. cunningly paſſes them over, it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently follows, That whatever the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church countenances, as long as ſhe remains a True Church, cannot be Fanaticiſme, nor Rebellion; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence ſhe is free from thoſe crimes. For why ſhould any one impute to her that, which ſhe does not countenance?</p>
               <p>To this the Dr. Anſwers (<hi>pag.</hi> 54.) Firſt, That <hi>he charged as Fanaticks ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons in our Church, who were never countenanced by her, neither did they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:102636:121"/>to her Authority.</hi> But what anſwer is this to me; who pretended only to clear our Church from Fanaticiſme? and how can ſhe be juſtly impeached of Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme, which ſhe does not allow of? Yea, the Principal deſign of the Dr. in that Chapter, was to Charge the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church with Fanaticiſme, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from its Title. But he adds, that he produced thoſe inſtances to prove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Adverſary <hi>T. G. That the Sects, and Fanaticiſms among Proteſtants here in England, could not be the effect of the reformation, ſince there were as wild, and extravagant Fanaticiſms before.</hi> Good! juſt, as if he ſhould have argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this manner. King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> or <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th,</hi> could not bring in Proteſtancy here in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe <hi>Luther</hi> had broached it before in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> There have been Fanaticks heretofore among the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, as there are now among Proteſtants: But with this difference; That the very Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Fanaticiſme; ſince it expreſsly prohibits men to be guided by their own private Reaſon in the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:102636:122"/>of Scripture, and obliges all to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to her judgment. On the contrary, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, according to Dr. <hi>St.</hi> 's Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, favours all ſorts of Fanaticiſme; ſince it permits every one to be led by his own private Spirit in the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture, without obliging him to ſubmit to the Judgment of any Church in ſuch matters.</p>
               <p>He anſwers ſecondly, that if <hi>whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is countenanced by the Authority of a True Church, ceaſes to be Fanaticiſme,</hi> there flow hence monſtrous Abſurdities. The firſt is, that a <hi>prevailing Fanaticiſme ceaſes to be Fanaticiſme,</hi> (<hi>pag.</hi> 55.) Is not this a ſtrange whimſie of the Drs. and a pregnant Argument, how little he values church Authority, to ſay, that becauſe ſome particular way of Devotion comes to be approved, and countenanced by the Authority of a True Church, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Church ſerves only to make it a greater, and a more prevailing Fanaticiſme, than it was before? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I proved in my Book (<hi>pag.</hi> 9.) with ſeveral inſtances, That the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of a True Church is ſufficient to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:102636:122"/>clear particular waies of Devotion from the imputation of Fanaticiſme. So that the difference between Fanatick, and Non-fanatick waies of Devotion, does not conſiſt in the extravagancy ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the one, and not of the other; (for both may be extravagant enough) but in that the former are againſt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the latter according to Authority. I will explain this Doctrine, with the Example the Dr. alledges in the place now quoted, of Treaſon and Rebellion. What difference is there between a Loyal, and Rebellious Army? Both Plunder, Harras, Fight, and Kill. The difference only is, that a Loyal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my proceeds according to Authority, and by order of their true Sovereign: But a Rebellious Army acts contrary to Authority, and to the orders of their Prince. As therefore it would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ridiculous to affirm, That the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of a True and Lawful Prince ſerves only to make the proceedings of his Subjects approved by him, more Rebellious, or a more prevailing Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion: ſo it is abſurd to defend, as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> does, That the approbation of a
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:102636:123"/>True Church renders particular waies of Devotion, approved by her, more lyable to Fanaticiſme, or a more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Fanaticiſme.</p>
               <p>But the Dr. urges, That this would be an excellent way to vindicate the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticiſme of the late times; which, <hi>becauſe countenanced by an Authority ſuppoſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent enough by ſome, who then writ of Obedience and Government, it ceaſes to be Fanaticiſme.</hi> Speak out Doctor, was <hi>Cromwell</hi> a True and Lawful Governour of this Kingdome, or not? if you ſay, he was not, how can you have the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to parallel our caſe with theirs? ſince you your ſelf defend the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be a True &amp; Lawful Church; and the very ſame with your own, if you ſay, that he was a True and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Governour, and his Authority com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent, where is your Loyalty? As for the Writer of the Book entituled <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Government,</hi> let him anſwer for himſelf. I deteſt that Doctrine: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther am I reſponſable for what that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor affirms: as neither Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will think himſelf obliged to own, whatever Proteſtants did in the late Rebellion.</p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:102636:123"/>
               <p>The ſecond Abſurdity he pretends to infer from our Doctrine is, That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Apoſtles, nay our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, are according to this Rule, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably Fanaticks. For <hi>what competent Authority,</hi> ſaies he (<hi>pag.</hi> 56.) <hi>had they to countenance them?</hi> Are you in earneſt Doctor, had Chriſt, the Prophets, and Apoſtles no competent Authority to countenance their proceedings? This indeed is to caſt them into the common heard of Fanaticks, ſince no competent Authority, neither Humane, nor Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, did countenance, or approve their Preaching. Can the Dr. deny, but that Chriſt, the Apoſtles, and Prophets were countenanced by Divine Authority, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted by unqueſtionable Miracles? or will he ſay, That Divine Authority, manifeſted by theſe Miracles, is not an Authority competent enough to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſuch actions as it approves of from the Crime of Fanaticiſme?</p>
               <p>But the Dr. preſſes, that the Jewiſh Church, though <hi>not yet caſt off, while our Saviour lived,</hi> did not countenance him, nor his Apoſtles. What then? did I ever affirm, that the Authority of a
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:102636:124"/>True Church was determinately neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to clear particular practices from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticiſme, as the Dr. moſt groſsly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes I did. I defended indeed, that the Authority of a True Church is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to clear ſuch actions from Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme; but I never aſſerted that it was neceſſary; yea I inſinuated the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (<hi>pag.</hi> 9.) There are two waies to commiſſion men to Preach, and to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize their manners of Devotion: Both of them ſufficient; but neither of them determinately neceſſary; the one extraordinary, when God by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Miracles declares, that ſuch men are commiſſioned by him: and in this manner Chriſt, the Prophets and the Apoſtles were commiſſioned by him: the other Ordinary; when the Paſtours of the True Church authorize men to Preach, or approve of ſuch particular waies of Devotion: and in this ſenſe I cleared the particular waies of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion countenanced by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; which the Dr. confeſſes to be a True Church; from the Aſperſion of Fanaticiſme. Neither can one reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably argue, that what is not countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:102636:124"/>in the Second and Ordinary way, is not countenanced by a competent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; ſince it may be approved of in an Extraordinary way.</p>
               <p>And though the Jews did not follow the Doctrine of Chriſt, yet they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his Commiſſion, and Gods Broad ſeal, <hi>viz.</hi> evident Miracles wrought by him; when in a full Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they affirmed (<hi>Joan</hi> 11.) <hi>Hic homo multa Signa facit; This man</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>works many Miracles:</hi> and certainly, ſuch a publick atteſtation as this was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to countenance and acknowledge his Commiſſion; though out of obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy they would not ſubmit to his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: as <hi>Pilate</hi> declared our Saviour to be innocent, and guiltleſs, yet out of fear, leſt he ſhould diſguſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him to death.</p>
               <p>I cannot omit here the two famous, yet Contradictory Revelations, which are ſaid to have been made to St. <hi>Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git,</hi> and St. <hi>Catherin,</hi> concerning the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Conception of our Bleſſed Lady: To St. <hi>Bridgit,</hi> that ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived without Original Sin; To St. <hi>Catherin,</hi> that ſhe was conceived with
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:102636:125"/>Original Sin. Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſcarce publiſhes a Book, wherein he does not inſert theſe Revelations; pretending thereby to blow up the Infallibility of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; ſince ſhe Canonized for Saints both St. <hi>Bridgit,</hi> and St. <hi>Catherin;</hi> and approves their Revelations; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſomething that is falſe; as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily one of the forementioned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations muſt be: particularly he endeavours to prove hence againſt me, That <hi>ſubmiſſion to the Judgment of the Church is not a Rule to judge Fanaticiſme by.</hi> For both theſe Revelations were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and yet one of them was falſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Fanatical: and one of thoſe Saints either was deceived, or went about to deceive; and by conſequence was a Fanatick. See the Dr. <hi>pag.</hi> 61, 62.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, that the Dr. has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet ſhewn, That thoſe two Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the abovementioned Saints, were approved of in particular by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or in general. True it is, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church declares them both to be Saints, and to be <hi>famous for their Revelations:</hi> but ſhe does not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:102636:125"/>approve of every porticular Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, related to have been made unto them. The whole Chriſtian Church looks upon Chriſt, and his Apoſtles as <hi>famous for their Miracles and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines:</hi> ſhall we therefore hence infer, that the whole Chriſtian Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of every particular Miracle, related of them by any Author whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and of every particular Doctrine which ſome one, or other teaches, to have been delivered by them? Are there not many falſe Miracles, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, father'd upon Chriſt and his Apoſtles? wherefore to the end, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be proved Fallible, by reaſon of the two forementioned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, contrary the one to the other, it was neceſſary for Dr. <hi>St.</hi> to have ſhewen, that they were both approved of by our Church: which the Dr. has not yet done. Thoſe two Saints might be famous for their Revelations, and deſervedly look'd upon as ſuch, though the aboveſaid two Revelations, or at leaſt one of them, had been forged.</p>
               <p>Moreover, though one of theſe two Revelations, as being contrary one to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:102636:126"/>the other, was falſe; and the perſon to whom ſuch a Revelation is ſayed to have been made, either deceived, or was deceived, ſuppoſing ſhe affirmed, that ſhe had had ſuch a Revelation; yet it does not therefore follow, that either ſuch a Revelation was Fanaticiſme, or ſuch a perſon a Fanatick. For ſure Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will not enlarge ſo much the roll of Fanaticks, as to affirm, <hi>That all ſuch as are deceived, are Fanaticks.</hi> For ſo he muſt caſt himſelf into that heard: ſince, certainly he is not ſo vain, as to think, that in no Interpretation of Scripture, in no Tenet whatſoever, of ſo many, as he has laid down in his Books, he has been deceived. Wherefore, as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Warr is not Rebellion, if it be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by the Authority, of a True and Lawful Sovereign Prince: For Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns may wage unjuſt Warrs: So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a falſe Revelation is Fanaticiſme, if it be countenanced by the Authority of the True Church; ſuppoſing, that the True Church may countenance ſuch Revelations. For it is <hi>Eſſential Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſme,</hi> as we have ſeen, to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Authority.</p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:102636:126"/>
               <p>I have enlarged my ſelf upon this point of Fanaticiſme, becauſe the Dr. ſeems to hugg it, as the <hi>Benjamin</hi> of his Mimical Wit, and preſumes ſo much of his endeavours in this kind, that he boldly atteſts, as we hinted above, that his Adverſaries have not ſaid ſo much as <hi>one wiſe word,</hi> to clear their Church from the Aſperſion of Fanaticiſme. The Dr. vapours, <hi>pag.</hi> 59. that this Charge of Fanaticiſme <hi>was a new Charge</hi> (yet the Author of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Stillingfleeton,</hi> tells us, whence he borrowed it) snd <hi>neither</hi> Bellarmin, Becanus, <hi>or any of their old beaten Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, could give them any aſſiſtance, they found not the Title of the Fanaticiſme of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, in any of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place Books; therefore plain Mother-wit muſt help them.</hi> 'Tis a wonder, that order has not been given to erect a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to Dr. <hi>St.</hi> for ſo rare an Invention as this is, of <hi>the Fanaticiſme of the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Church;</hi> and if his Mother-wit could help him, without the aſſiſtance of Common-place Books, to frame this new Charge againſt us, well may the Mother-wit of his Adverſaries help
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:102636:127"/>them, without needing the aſſiſtance of any <hi>Staunch-Author;</hi> for ſuch he terms our Antient Writers, to anſwer it? There is a ſhort way to anſwer Dr. <hi>St.</hi> 's Books, without needing to read Antient Authors. Read only his Books, and you will find the Anſwer to whatever he objects againſt us: ſo full they are of <hi>ſelf-contradictions:</hi> They are like to certain venemous Beaſts, that breed in themſelves the Antidote againſt their own poiſon.</p>
               <p>I have lately read a perfect Character of Dr. <hi>St's.</hi> proceedings, in charging <hi>Roman</hi> Church with Fanaticiſme, drawn by himſelf in a Sermon preached before his Majeſty 24. of <hi>February</hi> laſt, 1674. Where ſhewing, how licentious people among the Gentiles heretofore (as in theſe times among Chriſtians) <hi>brought Vertue into Contempt,</hi> and having aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the firſt <hi>Medium</hi> they laid hold of to effect their wicked deſign, <hi>viz. The ſeperating Religion and morality from each other,</hi> he adds (page 11.) Theſe words. <hi>The next thing was to make it [vertue] to appear ridiculous; which was a certain way to make Fools out of love with
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:102636:127"/>it:</hi> who do not conſider what is fit to be laughed at, but what is ſo. <hi>When</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, <hi>at</hi> Athens, <hi>undertook with many ſharp, and cutting Ironies, to reprove the vices of his age, and with a great deal of Wit and Reaſon, to perſwade men to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber practice of vertue, the licentious people knew not what to do with him: For they were not able to withſtand the force of his Argments. At laſt</hi> Ariſtophanes, <hi>(ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Comical Wit, whereby he was able to make any thing ſeem ridicalous) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he knew very well the Wiſdome and Learning of</hi> Socrates, <hi>yet to pleaſe, and humour the people, he brings him upon the Stage, and repreſents his grave inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons after ſuch a manner as turned all into a matter of laughter to the people of</hi> Athens — <hi>This is the method, which men take when they ſet their wits againſt Vertue, and Goodneſs: They know it is impoſſible to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue men out of it: but it is very eaſie, by ridiculous poſtures, and mimical geſtures, and profane Similitudes to put ſo grave, and modeſt a thing, as Vertue is, out of countenance, among thoſe, who are ſure to laugh on the other ſide. I do not think, that ſuch things can ſignifie much to wiſe men:
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:102636:128"/>but when was the world made up of ſuch? and therefore it ſignifies very much to the miſchief of thoſe, who have not the courage to love deſpiſed Vertue, nor to defend a cauſe that is laughed down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far the Dr. All which may be eaſily applied to Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>For the main task of the Dr. in his Treatiſe of <hi>the Fanaticiſme of the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Church,</hi> was to render ridiculous the Religious practices of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, and of ſo many Saints, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous throughout the world, for their Zeal and Piety; which (to uſe his own words) <hi>was a certain way to make fools out of love with</hi> our Church; <hi>who do not conſider what is fit to be laughed at, but what is ſo.</hi> He could not be ignorant of the great reputation, even the modern Saints of our Church deſervedly enjoy, upon account of their Vertue; far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what <hi>Socrates</hi> had: yet like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> having a Comical, and Drolling Wit, whereby he is able to make any thing, though never ſo Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, to ſeem ridiculous, <hi>only to pleaſe, and humour Licentious people,</hi> he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents their grave Inſtructions, and their
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:102636:128"/>Charitable and devout practices, in ſuch a manner, <hi>as he turns all into a matter of Laughter.</hi> He knows it is impoſſible, to argue judicious men out of the opinion they have of St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> St. <hi>Francis,</hi> St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and St. <hi>Tereſa:</hi> but it is very eaſie, by Mimical Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and profane Similitudes, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them ridiculous, and contemptible among thoſe, who <hi>are ſure to laugh on the other ſide.</hi> But ſuch proceedings can ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing to Wiſe men; but only to ſuch as <hi>have not courage, to love deſpiſed Vertue, nor to defend a Cauſe that is laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come, Come, Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> it is too notorious to all intelligent perſons, what you pretend with this ſcurrilous, &amp; drolling way of attacking the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Your aim is to bring all Religion and Vertue into Contempt, and Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, however you endeavour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guized ſo miſchievous a deſign with all Artifices poſſible. I wiſh from my heart, I were able to impute your Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and Miſcarriages in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſial Books, to Ignorance, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency: But on the one ſide your
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:102636:129"/>Miſtakes are ſo groſs, your Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo palpable, and your Aſperſions ſo notoriouſly ſcurrilous, that he muſt needs be a Fool, who cannot ſee them; and on the other ſide, the works you have publiſhed, do proclaim you no Fool; that I am forced to impute your unhandſome proceedings to the Malice of your Will, not the Ignorance of your Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>The Dr. (<hi>pag.</hi> 70.) endeavouring to ſtave off the Self-contradiction charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him, in imputing to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church Diviſions in matters of Faith, ſaies thus. <hi>But the fourth and fifth Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition (viz. of my Book in this point) are the moſt healing Principles, that have yet been thought on. Fie for ſhame! Why ſhould we and they of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel thus long! We are very well agreed in all matters of Faith; as I ſhall demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively prove it from the Argument of</hi> J. W. <hi>drawn from his two last Propoſitions.</hi> All, who aſſent unto the antient Creeds, are undivided in matters of Faith, by Prop. 4. But both Papiſts and Proteſtants do aſſent unto the Antient Creeds. — <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> they are undivided in matters of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:102636:129"/>Faith. <hi>And hath not</hi> J. W. <hi>now done his buſineſs, and very ſubſtantially proved the thing he intended? But I hope we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the benefit of it, as well as thoſe of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and that they will not henceforward charge us with dividing from their Church in any matters of Faith, ſince we are all agreed in owning the antient Creeds; and ſeeing we are not divided from the Church, but by differing in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, according to his Propoſition, it follows, that we are ſtill Members of the True Church; and therefore neither guilty of Hereſie, nor Sciſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By what Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſets down here, any prudent man may clearly ſee, how groſsly, and wilfully he miſtakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. My fourth Propoſition, ſet down by me, <hi>pag.</hi> 12. whereof the Dr. makes mention in the place now quoted, and to which I refer my ſelf in the Syllogiſm I frame, <hi>pag.</hi> 13. runs thus. <hi>All thoſe, who aſſent to the antient Creeds, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Dr.</hi> St. <hi>'s opinion</hi> (mark thoſe words) <hi>undivided in matters and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith;</hi> and that was the Dr. 's perſwaſion, I proved out of his <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Account, pag.</hi> 56, 58. and thence I
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:102636:130"/>conclude, <hi>pag.</hi> 13. that <hi>according to Dr.</hi> St. (mark thoſe words) <hi>All thoſe, who agree to the antient Creeds, are of the ſame Communion, and undivided in matters of Faith.</hi> Now this wiſe Dr. moſt groſsly ſuppoſes, that it is the ſame for me to ſay, <hi>All thoſe, who agree to the antient Creeds, are, according to Dr.</hi> St. <hi>undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in matters of Faith,</hi> (where I only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Dr. <hi>St.</hi> 's opinion, &amp; argue thence againſt him <hi>ad hominem</hi>) or to ſay abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, <hi>All thoſe, who agree to the antient Creeds, are undivided in matters of Faith:</hi> which words pronounced ſo without any modification, import, as if I were of that perſwaſion: whereas I am very far from it: neither here, nor in any other place, do I defend any ſuch Doctrine. Wherefore the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition, in the Syllogiſm ſet down by the Dr. is in <hi>his opinion</hi> True, (and conſequently may be ſubſervient to prove againſt him) but <hi>in my opinion</hi> it is falſe, and of no force to demonſtrate any thing againſt me: and I confeſs, that it is a very compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious way to compoſe the differences between me and the Dr. if one may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (as he here does) That <hi>what he
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:102636:130"/>ſaies, I ſay,</hi> and that it is the <hi>very ſame</hi> for me to affirm, ſuch a thing is ſo, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s opinion, or it is true, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> thinks ſo, and ſuch a thing is ſo, or it is true what Dr. <hi>St.</hi> thinks: which Propoſitions, doubtleſs, are very different. For, to the truth of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Propoſition 'tis enough, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> be of that opinion, whether his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion be true or falſe: but to the truth of the latter, 'tis requiſite, that his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion be true, and that what he ſaies be ſo, as he ſaies it is.</p>
               <p>Certainly, Chriſtians may truly affirm without forfeiting their Faith, that <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of the Jews, Chriſt is not the Meſſias:</hi> will the Dr. therefore infer hence, that Chriſtians may truly affirm, that <hi>Chriſt is not the Meſſias?</hi> or that <hi>Chriſtians and Jews are agreed in that main point?</hi> Fie for ſhame! (to uſe your own expreſſion) you a Doctor of Divinity, and cannot diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Propoſitions ſo notoriouſly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent? Where is the ingenuity you ſo much boaſt of? Sure you imagined, that the Reader would be ſo ſilly, as to take upon your bare word, what you write,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:102636:131"/>or quote, without ever examining, or comparing it. By what I have ſaid in reference to the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition of his Syllogiſme, whereby he pretends to prove demonſtratively againſt us, That both Catholicks and Proteſtants are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in matters of Faith, any one many judge, what Demonſtrations we are to expect from Dr. <hi>St.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As concerning the <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition of the Drs. Syllogiſme, he ſuppoſes it to be the ſame with my Fifth; wherein he is alſo wilfully miſtaken. For my Fifth Propoſition is this, <hi>All Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks aſſent unto the antient Creeds;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as his <hi>Minor</hi> was this, <hi>Both Papiſts and Proteſtants do aſſent unto the Antient Creeds;</hi> where he adds, That <hi>Proteſtants aſsent unto the Antient Creeds;</hi> which I never affirmed: and the Dr. cannot be ignorant, that <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> hold Proteſtants do not believe in that Article even of the Apoſtles Creed, <hi>Sanctam Eccleſiam Catholicam;</hi> which in its true, and legitimate ſenſe ſignifies the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church: and thoſe only are to be thought to believe Scripture, and the Antient Creeds, who believe them
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:102636:131"/>in the true, and legitimate ſenſe: which in our Doctrine is only that ſenſe, which is agreable, or not repugnant, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church. So that Proteſtants, according to the perſwaſion of Catholicks, do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Antient Creeds; becauſe they do not believe them rightly underſtood: But according to Dr. <hi>St. 's</hi> opinion <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholicks do believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Antient Creeds, rightly underſtood. For his Rule is, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever underſtands Scripture, or the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Creeds, as by <hi>his natural faculty of diſcerning Truth and Falſhood, he thinks they are to be underſtood, ſuch an one right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtands them.</hi> Now <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks underſtand them, as the Natural Faculty in them of diſcerning Truth and Falſhood, teaches them: and Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ought to believe that we do ſo, as he will have us to believe the like of him: and if we do ſubmit to the judgment of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the true interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of the Antient Creeds, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon that is in us, teaches us ſo to do. And ſure Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will not ſo far
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:102636:132"/>abaſe the Authority of the True Church, and of her Doctors, as to aſſert, that whoever is induced by their Authority, to believe ſuch to be the true ſenſe of ſuch particular places of Scripture, as they expound them in, muſt needs miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpret them.</p>
               <p>Hence I infer, that neither the <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition in the Drs. Syllogiſme is granted by us: and is not the Dr. like to demonſtrate many things, if ſuch be his Demonſtrations, that both the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> are denied by his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries? is not this to do his buſineſs <hi>very ſubſtantially?</hi> Yet the formenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Syllogiſme is a demonſtration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dr. that <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks and Proteſtants are undivided in matters of Faith <hi>according to his opinion;</hi> and conſequently muſt be granted by him to be <hi>both of the ſame Church:</hi> and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded thence above, that he muſt either deny the Proteſtant Church to be True, or grant the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be ſo.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Syllogiſme I form, <hi>pag.</hi> 13. out of my Fourth and Fifth Propoſition. is a demonſtration againſt Dr. <hi>St.</hi> That all <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, as
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:102636:132"/>long as they remain ſo, are undivided in matters of Faith: which is all I there pretended. For I never intended to prove, that they were ſo undivided with ſuch, as are out of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Some Difficulties raiſed by the Dr. againſt my Judgment concerning his manner of proceeding, Rejected.</head>
               <p>BEfore I make an end, I cannot but take notice of ſome Difficulties Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſets down in his particular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, relating to the Judgment I frame of his manner of Proceeding, in theſe words couched by me <hi>pag.</hi> 11. <hi>I verily believe, that Dr.</hi> St. <hi>did his Intereſt byaſs him that way, could with</hi> Lucian, Porphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, <hi>and thoſe many Libertines of our Country, (the ſpawn of ſuch Books as theſe) he could I ſay, flurt with as much picquantneſs, and railery at Chriſtian Religion, as he does as the</hi> Roman, <hi>char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:102636:133"/>Chriſtians with Superſtitions, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and Diſſenſions.</hi> What does he not ſay againſt theſe words? He calls them <hi>a baſe Suggeſtion, wherein there is no colour of Truth.</hi> (pag. 8.) <hi>A ſlie Inſinuation: a Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny too groſs, to need any farther An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> (pag. 9.) and that <hi>it had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have called him at Atheiſt in plain terms.</hi> p. 8. I perceive the man is angry. 'Tis neceſſary to treat him mildly, that he may come to himſelf. But withal I reflect, that many do endeavour to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with Anger, the want of Reaſon, and to Hector one with Bravadoes into their opinion, when they cannot draw him with Arguments.</p>
               <p>Let us examin in particular what he objects againſt the fore-mentioned words. He ſaies <hi>That I very honeſtly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Chriſtian Religion, and the Roman from each other.</hi> And ſure, I ſhould not deal honeſtly, did I not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion from the Chriſtian, as a <hi>Species</hi> from the <hi>Genus,</hi> and as a <hi>part</hi> from the <hi>whole.</hi> For we do not deny, but that there are many vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly called Chriſtians, becauſe they are
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:102636:133"/>truly Chriſtened, and profeſs to believe in Chriſt, and acknowledge the Apoſtles Creed, although interpreted in their way. Such were <hi>Donatiſts, Pelagians, Arians,</hi> and others, held by us, and Proteſtants too, for Hereticks; who are never owned to be <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks. I confeſs, I have not learn'd, as yet, ſo great kindneſs for our Church, as to make it the ſame Individual Church, (thoſe who do ſo with their own Church, let them anſwer for themſelves) with an Heretical, nay with an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Church. Wherefore 'tis manifeſt, that the Chriſtian Religion, taken in the aforeſaid ſenſe, does comprehend more than the <hi>Roman.</hi> So that what I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the forementioned place, was, that the way Dr. <hi>St.</hi> takes to impugne the particular Tenets of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, does, if it be of any force, annul the <hi>common Principles</hi> of Chriſtianity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all thoſe, who own themſelves to be Chriſtians, do agree: And that this was my meaning, any one, who was not reſolved to quibble, might eaſily have ſeen.</p>
               <p>In the next place he asks me, <hi>pag.</hi> 8.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:102636:134"/>
                  <hi>What is this</hi> verily believe <hi>of mine ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon?</hi> Doubtleſs the rage my words put him into, did not let him ſee what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. For I layed down the Reaſons of what before I aſſerted, in theſe words. <hi>For if it be a rational way of proceeding, to rally together whatever has been objected by the Enemies of a Community, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king mention of the Anſwers given by them, or the ſentence pronounced in their favour; and to Father upon the whole Body, the miſdemeanours of ſome members, although diſowned by the Major part,</hi> (which are the Artifices uſed by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> in his works againſt Catholicks) <hi>what Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>munity is there ſo holy, which may not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be traduced?</hi> All this the Dr. very handſomly omits, without ſo much as anſwering a word thereunto. For he is too wiſe to take notice of any thing, that may prejudice his deſign; and only is pleaſed to divert the Reader with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Queſtions: as whether <hi>This</hi> verily believe <hi>of mine be grounded upon the Authority of</hi> our Church, or <hi>rather upon ſome Viſion, or Revelation made by ſome of our Saints?</hi> Whereas in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned words the Motives of that
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:102636:134"/>my belief are clearly ſet down. The Dr. cannot deny, but that among Chriſtians, even of the Primitive Church, there were committed Inceſt, Simony, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and ſeveral other horrid Crimes, worſe than thoſe, which the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens did commit; as may be gathered out of the Goſpel, the Acts, and the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles; and that there were Hereſies among them, as that of the <hi>Nicolaites.</hi> Wherefore, if the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours of ſome Members may be fathered upon the whole Community, although diſowned by the Major part, this abſurdity would follow, that the Chriſtan Religion, even when it was in its Primitive purity, might be called an Inceſtuous Simonical, Adulterous, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical, and a worſe Religion than Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſme.</p>
               <p>Again, 'tis certain, that many Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous things were objected by the Jews againſt our Saviour; as he was a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, a Seducer, a Drunkard, and that he Preached Sedition; and that he was poſſeſs'd by the Devil, and that the Religion he founded, was a ridiculous, ſcandalous, and Superſtitious Religion.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:102636:135"/>Now ſhould one of a picquant, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious wit, repreſent theſe, and ſeveral other blemiſhes, objected againſt Chriſt, &amp; his Religion, without taking notice of the Anſwers given them, nor of the preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Arguments, produced in favour, and vindication of Chriſt and his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; what a low opinion, what an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from Chriſtian Religion, would ſuch a man breed in thoſe, who either by reaſon of their Education, or upon ſome other account were ignorant of the true condition of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and had already ſome prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it?</p>
               <p>That theſe are the Artifices uſed by Dr. <hi>Still.</hi> againſt <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks might be evidenced by ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances taken out of his works. One of the proofs that he alledges, to evince the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be guilty of Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſme (for that was his intent) are the extravagancies of the <hi>Alumbradoe's</hi> and <hi>Fratricelli;</hi> who were not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned, but condemned by the Prelates of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>Moreover, he pretends to father up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the <hi>Gun-powder</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:102636:135"/>Treaſon, though deteſted by <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks; and without ſo much as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of the Sentence, that King <hi>James,</hi> who was moſt concerned in that plot, gave in Vindication of Catholicks, in his own Declaration about it, ſaying, <hi>That the generality of his Catholick Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects did abhor ſuch a deteſtable Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, no leſs than he himſelf.</hi> If ſuch Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces therefore as theſe be warrantable, <hi>what Community is there ſo holy,</hi> (I ſay again) <hi>which may not eaſily be traduced?</hi> Should God permit Dr. <hi>St.</hi> as certainly he may, to declare himſelf a Jew, or an Atheiſt; he has already laid up good ſtore of Arguments, wherewith, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his manner of proceeding, to traduce Chriſtianity; Fathering upon the Chriſtian Religion all the horrible ſins, that ever have been committed by any Chriſtian whatſoever, Proteſtant or Catholick. And if he ſhould want mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to fill up his Volumes, as following this way of attacking his Adverſary, he ſcarce ever can; he may ſuppoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians either to teach Crimes which they do not teach; or what they do teach, to be Crimes: which is the way he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:102636:136"/>takes, to oppugne <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</p>
               <p>Since therefore the ſame Topicks, and Reaſons drawn from them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Dr. <hi>St.</hi> endeavours to traduce the particular Tenets of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may without difficulty, be levelled againſt the general Principles of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion; That he has been pleaſed to make uſe of thoſe Arguments, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the former, than the latter, could not proceed out of more Reaſon for the one, than for the other; and conſequently it proceeded from ſome Intereſt, (which has ſo great an Adſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent over the hearts of men) or other paſſion, that byaſs'd him that way. Whence I affirmed, that had the ſame paſſion of Intereſt byaſſed him againſt Chriſtian Religion, which made him ſo malicious againſt the <hi>Roman,</hi> it is very credible, that he would have ſhewen himſelf as pieviſh againſt the one as the other. All this I have ſaid to ſignifie, what it was, that this <hi>verily believe</hi> of mine was founded upon.</p>
               <p>In confirmation of what was couched in the forementioned words, I added
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:102636:136"/>immediately, <hi>But this Dr. is ſo unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as well in vindicating the Proteſtant, as in attacking the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, that he neither produces any thing in vindication of Proteſtancy, but the ſame, or the like, may be alledged in defence of Socinianiſme, and other Hereſies, condemned as ſuch by Protestants.</hi> [See <hi>the Guide in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, Diſcourſe</hi> 4.] nor <hi>oppoſes any thing against the</hi> Roman <hi>Religion; but the ſame, or the like, may be objected by Jews, or Pagans, againſt the Chriſtian: which, according to Scripture, is a ſcandal to the former, and a deriſion to the latter. So that whoever will be pleaſed to reflect ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly upon his Diſcourſes, he may clearly ſee, that his Proofs for Proteſtancy will aſſoon make one a Socinian, as a Proteſtant; and his objections againſt Catholicks will aſſoon make one no Christian, as no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</hi> And what does the Dr. anſwer to all this? All that he could; which is juſt nothing: not taking ſo much as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the forementioned words: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they contain two main points; which are proved at large by ſeveral Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Authors, and do utterly ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate whatſoever Dr. <hi>St.</hi> brings for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:102636:137"/>or againſt us: and do moreover force the Dr. himſelf, to ſalve whatever he produces againſt Catholicks, if he will be a Chriſtian; and to confeſs the inanity of whatever he alledges for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, as ſuch, if he will not be a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian.</p>
               <p>The firſt point is, that he alledges no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in defence of Proteſtancy as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy, which may not be alledged, and with the ſame force too, in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Socinianiſme, or any other herefie. This point has been diſcuſs'd at large by thoſe two famous, and ſolid Divines, the Author of <hi>Proteſtancy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Principles,</hi> and <hi>The Guide in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies,</hi> (Diſc. 4. now quoted) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is contained a Plea between a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and a Socinian. And although Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has had at laſt the courage to offer at an anſwer to the forementioned Books, yet he has not dared to touch this point: which is no ſmall confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the opinion ſome have conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is a Socinian: and yet the Church of <hi>England</hi> looks upon Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians as Hereticks.</p>
               <p>The ſecond point is, That Dr. <hi>St.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:102636:137"/>nothing againſt the particular Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but the ſame, or the like, may be objected by Jews, Turks, Pagans, or Libertins, againſt the Common Principles of Chriſtianity: Neither is he ignorant, but that ſome Pagans look upon our Scriptures as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. no leſs than Dr. <hi>St.</hi> looks upon the Legends of our Saints as ſuch. The Jews alſo denyed the New Teſtament; and the Turks make our Scripture to truckle under to their Alcoran. This point is ſolidly diſcuſs'd in that erudite Book, <hi>Reaſon and Religion:</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Dr. pretends to anſwer it, yet he prudently waves this point, or very ſlightly touches it; ſpending the far greater part of his Anſwer in ſcoffing at the Miracles of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; even thoſe, which have been authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally approved in particular by her in the Canonization of Saints; thinking this a fit ſubject for his drolling Wit. Yet what he there ſaies concerning this Argument, is a new confirmation of this our ſecond point. For he objects no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing material againſt the Miracles of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; but the ſame, or
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:102636:138"/>the like, is, or may be objected by Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertins againſt the Miracles of Chriſt, the Prophets and the Apoſtles; as the ſame Author, in his late reply does make apparent.</p>
               <p>Yet the Dr. to ſhew us that he is a Chriſtian, ſaies (<hi>pag.</hi> 8.) <hi>That he has made it his buſineſs to aſſert the Truth of Christian Religion, in a large Diſcourſe, ſeveral years ſince, publiſhed by him.</hi> But to this he himſelf anſwers, bringing the Example of <hi>Vanninus,</hi> who writ for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, when he denied a Deity. <hi>pag.</hi> 9. he concludes thus. <hi>In plain terms, I know but one way to ſatisfie ſuch as you are; (but I will keep from it as long as I can:) and that is to go to</hi> Rome, <hi>and to be burn'd for my Faith: For that is the kindneſs there ſhewed to thoſe, who contend for the purity of Chriſtian Religion, againſt the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the</hi> Roman. But the Dr. muſt pardon me, if I tell him plainly, that I cannot believe, he would ever be burn'd for defending the particular Tenets of the Proteſtant Church, ſince he himſelf affirms, in his <hi>Rational Account,</hi> pag. 54, 55. That <hi>ſuch Tenets are neither Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith, nor neceſſary to be believed,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:102636:138"/>either</hi> neceſſitate medij, <hi>or</hi> praeeepti: <hi>no Legacies of Christ, or his Apoſtles; but only inferiour Truths, and meer pious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; which no body is bound to believe.</hi> Nay we cannot be ſecure, that the Dr. does aſſent to them; but perhaps in his heart he holds the contrary Doctrines. For, according to his Cavils <hi>about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Prieſt,</hi> one can have no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the <hi>intention,</hi> or <hi>thoughts</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men. And why ſhould I think, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> does love ſo little his own life, as to be burn'd for the defence of ſuch Tenets, which, according to his own Principles, he is not bound to aſſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and perhaps, in his heart, for ought I know, he does not believe them to be true. Certain it is, that ſhould he be burn'd for them, he would not be burn'd for his Faith, nor be a Martyr upon that account: ſince even in his own o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, they are not <hi>Articles of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, ſhould Dr. <hi>St.</hi> be burn'd at <hi>Rome</hi> for contradicting, or oppoſing the Religion there eſtabliſhed, he would be burn'd as a Malefactour, even accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own Churches Principles. For it is the Doctrine of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:102636:139"/>Church, that all <hi>Soveraign Temporal Princes,</hi> at leaſt ſuch as are Chriſtians, are <hi>Supream Heads of the Church</hi> in their reſpective Dominions, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that all are bound, as long as they are in ſuch Dominions, not to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, nor oppoſe the Religion there eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the Supream Prince. Since therefore Proteſtants confeſs the Pope to be Supream Temporal Prince of <hi>Rome,</hi> and its adjacent Territories, and accordingly to be Supream Head of the Church in thoſe places, ſeeing they own him to be a true Chriſtian Prince, (though they will needs have him to be Antichriſt) in manifeſtly follows, that even according to Proteſtant Principles, if Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ſhould be puniſhed at <hi>Rome</hi> for oppoſing the Religion there eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and for drawing from it the Popes Subjects, he would ſuffer as a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour.</p>
               <p>Beſides, how civil <hi>Rome</hi> has ſhewen her ſelf to ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, perſons of Quality, who have gone thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to view the Curioſities of the City, they themſelves, many of them being yet alive, can witneſs: and from ſuch
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:102636:139"/>inſtances the world may judge, whether <hi>Rome</hi> has not been kinder to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, than <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Italian</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. Yea, if Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has ſo much zeal, as to be burn'd for his Religion, 'tis not neceſſary for him to go ſo far as <hi>Rome.</hi> They may do him that kindneſs here in <hi>England;</hi> where ſeveral have been burn'd for Socinians, ſince Proteſtancy came in. In fine, we may ſecure Dr. <hi>St.</hi> that ſhould he perſiſt at <hi>Rome,</hi> to grant ſuch palpable Contradictions, as we have ſhewen he does, he would never be burn'd there for his Religion: yet I would not ſecure him, that in ſuch a caſe he ſhould not be ſhaved, and ſent to the <hi>Pazzarelli,</hi> as happened ſome years agoe to Three <hi>Engliſh</hi> Quakers: who having gone to <hi>Rome</hi> to Convert the Pope, as they ſaid, and Preaching in the publick Streets in a forreign Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, (it ſeems they had not yet the <hi>Gift of Tongues</hi>) were look'd upon as Madmen, and accordingly committed to <hi>Bedlam.</hi> Yet ſoon after, information being given in by ſome of our Nation, what manner of people they were, they were preſently ſet at liberty; and they
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:102636:140"/>offered to ſupply them with Moneyes; which they refuſed. Whether, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> would imitate them in this, I know not.</p>
               <p>The Dr. in his ſecond Diſcourſe, in the Dedicatory to the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> ſaies, <hi>That if he once loſes his Senſes, or his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> that is, if he once falls mad, <hi>he knows not whether it may be his Fortune to be carried to</hi> Rome. But fear not, Dr. you will certainly be left in <hi>London,</hi> to go about the Streets rant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Popery, and Popiſh Idolatry; (For commonly Madmen harp upon thoſe things, which made them run mad) or Singing the <hi>Catholick Ballad,</hi> or ſome ſuch other, to <hi>Tom a Bedlams Tune:</hi> and it will not be hard for the Dr. to ſay them without Book. For, as one affirmed, as truly as ingeniouſly, all ſuch Ballads, which have been lately publiſhed, are nothing elſe but Dr. <hi>St.</hi> put in Rhime. And the Dr. would do then quite as much good, by ſinging ſuch Ballads againſt Popery, as he has done hitherto by Preaching the like things againſt it. Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s Works were heretofore look'd upon as Play-Books, as I have already Inſinuated. But now
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:102636:140"/>it ſeems, they have degenerated into Ballads. He is reſolved (I ſee) out of his exceeding great Charity, and Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to oblige all ſorts of Merry Wits.</p>
               <p>Neither do I blame the Dr. for what he has Writ in defence of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: yet I muſt tell him, that none court one more, than ſuch as are ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contriving his Ruine. What I blame in him is, That with the Objections he makes againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he deſtroys Chriſtian Religion, which before he had vindicated; and pulls down with one hand, what he had ſet up with the other: and I have evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced already, that it is not enough for a Chriſtian, to aſſent unto all the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Tenets of Chriſtianity, but 'tis alſo neceſſary not to teach any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to any of them.</p>
               <p>But the Dr. retorts the Argument; and will needs have us to deſtroy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity with our manner of proceeding, (<hi>pag.</hi> 9.) and that <hi>we cannot maintain the cauſe we have eſpouſed, without plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe, who relie upon our word, into the depth of Atheiſme.</hi> He conceives (forſooth) a great fear (alas, good
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:102636:141"/>man!) that ſome, being preſs'd by our Arguments; will rather become no Chriſtians, or turn flat Atheiſts, than <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholicks. Such is the hatred, and prejudice they have againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>The inanity of this Objection has been laid open above: it is grounded upon this pitiful Principle, <hi>That we ought not to preſs men, out of good and ſolid Maxims, which they themſelves aſſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, to prove what we pretend, leaſt (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) rather than they will grant what we endeavour to prove, they will denie thoſe common Principles, wherein they agreed with us:</hi> and by conſequence make the gap, and difference between us wider. If Chriſtian Religion be ſo beautiful, ſolid, and incorrupt, as certainly it is; and the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion ſo Superſtitious, Idolatrous, &amp; Ridiculous as he fancies it to be, ſure they are as different one from the other, as black from white. And what fear can there be, that men ever take white for black, or black for white; unleſs he ſuppoſes thoſe, with whom he deals, to have quite loſt their ſenſes, and underſtandings: yea to compare
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:102636:141"/>them together, if they be ſo different, is the beſt way, to make the Beauty of the one, and the Ill favouredneſs of the other, appear the greater, according to that Maxime, <hi>Oppoſita juxta ſe poſita ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis eluceſcunt.</hi> So that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates, do evidence to the world, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they have a very low opinion of Chriſtian Religion, even when it was in its greateſt purity; ſince they think it ſo hard, that being faced with the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, (which ſeems to them to be ſo full of Corruptions, Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and abominations) the one may be diſtinguiſhed from the other: or that the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion is not ſo ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, and ill-favoured, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it to be; ſince it is ſo like the Chriſtian Religion, even in its greateſt Purity, that being compared together, 'tis extream difficult to know which is which; and that by ſuch a parallel men are incited, either to embrace them both, or reject them both.</p>
               <p>The Dr. goes yet farther; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ſupply with counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed zeal the difficiency of true, and ſolid reaſons, puts down theſe words, <hi>pag.</hi>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:102636:142"/>11. <hi>I would fain know of theſe men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do in earneſt make no difference between the Writings of ſuch as Mother</hi> Juliana, <hi>and the Books of Scripture; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Revelations of St.</hi> Bridgit, <hi>St.</hi> Catherin, <hi>&amp;c. and thoſe of the Prophets; between the actions of St.</hi> Francis, <hi>and</hi> Ignatius Loyola, <hi>and thoſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? if they do not, I know who they are, that expoſe our Religion to purpoſe. If they do make a difference, how can the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting their Viſions, and practiſes, reflect diſhonour upon the other, ſo infinitely above them, ſo much more certainly conveighed down to us, with the conſent of the whole Chriſtian world?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In anſwer to this Objection, I would fain know of the Dr. whether he does in earneſt, make no difference between a Door, a Vine, a Worm, a Lamb, a Shepheard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Chriſt, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? If he does not, then Chriſt is no better than a Door, a Vine, a Worm, a Lamb, a Shepheard; which to affirm, is Blaſphemy: if he makes a difference, how does the Scripture compare Chriſt to things ſo infinitely beneath him? Now if he ſaies, that theſe things,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:102636:142"/>though infinitely beneath Chriſt, yet in ſome of their Properties may reſemble him, and his virtues; and upon that account he is compared unto them, without any blemiſh, or reflexion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his honour; why might not we, without reflecting any diſhonour upon Chriſt, ſay, that Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> Saint <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and other Canonized Saints of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, do in their Virtues, Miracles, and Practiſes, reſemble thoſe of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely above them?</p>
               <p>Beſides, 'tis manifeſt, that Chriſt, and his works, as being an infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, derived from the dignity of the perſon, were far more above the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and their works, than thoſe were above the particular Saints of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, and their practices: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we have the ſame Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Topicks, to believe the matters of Fact, of the Apoſtles and Prophets, as thoſe of Chriſt, though ſo far beyond them: and whoever ſhould deny the former, without doubt he would open a way to deny the latter. Although therefore the practiſes, and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:102636:143"/>Revelations of the particular Saints of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be, in ſeveral Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances inferiour to thoſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Prophets; yet there may be the ſame Motives, and Inducements, (we ſpeak antecedently to Scripture, taken as the word of God, as when we prove againſt Pagans the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles) to believe the one as the other: So that ſhould one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Virtues, Revelations, and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, conſtantly related, and believed, concerning the <hi>Roman</hi> Saints, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by our Church, (for of ſuch Virtues, Revelations, and Practiſes we ſpeak in this preſent debate) he would, doubtleſs, give a great occaſion to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, to deny, or queſtion, the Virtues, Revelations, and Practiſes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Prophets. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame Motives, Inducements, and Topicks, may ſerve for the belief of things very different one from another; which is what I pretended: and if they are of no force in the one, neither are they in the other. Yet one would think, that the harder the thing is, and the more ſublime, the ſtronger Inducements
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:102636:143"/>are requiſite to believe it. So that, if the unanimous conſent of ſo many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and pious men is not ſufficient to induce a Proteſtant to believe the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and tranſactions of St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> handed down by ſo general a Tradition, and of a far freſher date, how ſhall the like conſent be ſufficient to induce Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, to believe the works of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, far more wonderful, and of a ſtaler date? For commonly, matters of Fact of a freſh date are more eaſily prov'd, and believed, than of a ſtaler. The difference therefore incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> between Chriſt and his Apoſtles on the one ſide, and the proper Saints of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Superminency of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer above the latter, is ſo far from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing the force of our Argument, that it rather increaſes it.</p>
               <p>Again, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and his Partizans, commonly defend, that the certainty we have, that ſuch Books are Scripture, and that they were penned by ſuch Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whoſe names are prefixed unto them, is of the ſame nature with the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:102636:144"/>certainty, that we have, that ſuch Books were written by <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> or <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> which are unanimouſly aſſented unto, as <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> or <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Works: and the certainty we have, that there have been ſuch men as Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and that they did ſuch and ſuch things, which are commonly aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto them, with the certainty we have, that there have been in the world ſuch men, as <hi>William the Conquerour, Julius Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth,</hi> and that they have done ſuch things, as una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly are attributed unto them. So that whoever ſhould deny all ſuch meer Humane Hiſtories, would be in a fair way to deny, that ever there have been ſuch men as Chriſt, and his Apoſtles; or that they have done ſuch things, which Chriſtians unanimouſly aſcribe unto them.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine ſuppoſed, (whether true or falſe I do not now diſpute) I would once more fain know of the Dr. whether he <hi>does in earneſt make no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Books of Scripture, and the Books of</hi> Livy, <hi>and</hi> Plutarch; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and their
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:102636:144"/>Practiſes, and <hi>William</hi> the Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Julius Caeſar, Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth,</hi> Practiſes? if not, <hi>then we know who they are, that expoſe Chriſtian Religion to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:</hi> if he does make a difference, how does he make this Parallel, between things, ſo far eſtranged the one from the other? and if he ſaies, the Parallel he makes is not between the perſons, or things themſelves, but between the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the one and the other; (and there may be, without doubt, the ſame kind of certainty concerning things very different) let him apply to the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his Argument made againſt us, and he will ſee, how it comes to nothing. For what we pretend, is, that there is the ſame, or the like certainty, the ſame, or the like motives, and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (we ſpeak here antecedently to Scripture <hi>held to be the word of God;</hi> for ſuch it is not held to be by Pagans) to believe, that there have been ſuch men, as St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> St. <hi>Francis,</hi> St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and that they have done ſuch things, as are unanimouſly attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them by <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, without any heſitation, as that there
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:102636:145"/>have been ſuch men as Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; and that they have done ſuch things as are univerſally aſcribed unto them by Chriſtians. So that whoever ſhould deny, that there was ever ſuch a man as St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> or that he ever foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any Order of Religious men, he might eaſily in the like manner be brought to queſtion, or deny, that there ever was any ſuch man as Chriſt, or that he ever founded Chriſtian Religion: there being the ſame, or the like evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the one, as for the other, ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently to Scripture owned as the Word of God; <hi>viz.</hi> a conſtant Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men; although Chriſt, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion be far above St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and his Order.</p>
               <p>I do not deny, but that there is a more Univerſal Tradition for the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and Tranſactions of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, than for the particular Actions and Miracles, of the forementioned <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Saints. But what then? may there not be ſeveral degrees in the ſame kind of certainty? Proteſtants aver, as we have ſeen, that there is the ſame kind of certainty, and evidence, againſt
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:102636:145"/>a Pagan for the Miracles of Chriſt, as for the Actions of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> though theſe are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended upon by a more Univerſal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; ſince Jews and Pagans, who deny Chriſts Miracles, aſſent unto the Actions of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and <hi>Julius Caeſar:</hi> and yet both we, and Proteſtants affirm, that they may as well deny, or queſtion the one as the other.</p>
               <p>Moreover, there is Tradition enough to induce a Moral certainty for all, and every Book of the Scripture: and yet doubtleſs there is a more general Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſome Books of Scripture, than for others; for the Old Teſtament, than for the New; and for ſome parts of the New, than for others. In the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, though the Tradition for Chriſts, and his Apoſtles Miracles, be more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, than for the Miracles of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Roman</hi> Saints, approved of by our Church; yet the Tradition for theſe is ſo general, that it renders them Morally certain: ſo that whoever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds rationally, upon the account of Humane Tradition, will either allow both, or neither. Let's ſuppoſe, that
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:102636:146"/>there are in the world a hundred Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſtians; and that threeſcore Millions of them are <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks: For even Proteſtants confeſs, that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholicks alone make up the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of Chriſtendome. Now whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has the confidence to deny the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> though aſſented unto by ſo many Millions of <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and for the ſpace of above a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, he would not ſtick, ſhould the like paſſion carry him that way, to queſtion the Miracles of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, though agreed on by the whole Body of Chriſtians, and for the ſpace of above a Thouſand, and ſix Hundred years. Can we imagin, that any prudent man does now believe the Miracles of Chriſt, becauſe there is ſuch a preciſe number in the world (and no leſſer) of Chriſtians, who aſſent unto them, or rather becauſe there is a vaſt number of Chriſtians, that unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly aſſert them? and certainly the number of Catholicks alone is a vaſt number. Or would it not be a madneſs for one to ſay, That were there no more Chriſtians in the world, to atteſt the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:102636:146"/>Miracles of Chriſt, than there are <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholicks, he would not think himſelf obliged to believe them upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to Tradition, and conſent in their favour: when as 'tis certain, there was a time, when there were no more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the world, than now there are <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks: and yet even then, doubtleſs, there was Tradition, and Conſent, ſufficient to render the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable.</p>
               <p>And thus far concerning the Parallel between the Miracles, and Practiſes of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and thoſe of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Canonized Saints: ſuppoſing the Actions of the latter to be inferiour (as really they are in ſeveral Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) to thoſe of the former. Yet our Saviour expreſsly ſaies, <hi>John</hi> 14.12. <hi>I ſay unto you, He that believes in me, the works that I do, he ſhall do; and greater works than theſe ſhall he do:</hi> which words, even according to <hi>Calvin,</hi> and other Sectaries, extend not only to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but alſo to the whole Body of the Church in ſucceeding Ages. So that, not only the Miracles, and practiſes of the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:102636:147"/>Apoſtles, but alſo thoſe of modern Saints of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, conſidered in themſelves, are as great, or greater, than thoſe of Chriſt. Did Chriſt do Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, raiſing the Dead, caſting out Devils, curing ſuddenly the Lame, the Deaf, the Dumb, and others infected with incurable Diſeaſes? So did the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and ſeveral Apoſtolical men of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Did Chriſt Foretel things to come? So did the Apoſtles, and <hi>Roman</hi> Saints. Did Chriſt Convert many with his Preaching? So did the Apoſtles, and ſeveral Saints of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church. Was Chriſt a Pattern of Charity, Humility, Patience, and all other Virtues? The Apoſtles, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny famous <hi>Roman</hi> Saints have imitated his Virtues: Notwithſtanding what Chriſt did, he did it by his own power, being Omnipotent; but what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and other Apoſtolical men did in this kind, they did it by the vertue, and power Chriſt liberally conferred upon them. And therefore Chriſt was the Principal Agent of all ſuch works.</p>
               <p>Now let any one judge, whether the Parallel between the Inducements we
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:102636:147"/>have to be Chriſtians, and thoſe, which we have to be Catholicks; and the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of both, antecedently to Scripture <hi>owned as the word of God,</hi> be ſo unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as that only with an Admiration or two, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> could prudently think to blow it off. Wherefore I repeat what I have already ſaid, That the Drs. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks will aſſoon make one no Chriſtian, as no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</p>
               <p>And as for ſeveral Extravagant, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe, and myſtical expreſſions, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges out of the Revelations, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Canonized Saints of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, branding them for Fanaticiſme, the Dr. might, as I inſinuated in my Book, produce out of the Revelations of St. <hi>John,</hi> and the <hi>Canticles,</hi> (which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account are daſh'd out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Scriptures by ſome Proteſtants) quite as ſtrange, and extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and Practiſes. But Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is of thoſe men, who whatever they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not, they Blaſpheme: and he is as unacquainted with myſtical Divinity, as with other Faculties; which he has a greater obligation to know. Now if the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:102636:148"/>
                  <hi>Canticles,</hi> and <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> are ſufficiently cleared from Fanaticiſme, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many ſtrange, and abſtruſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions they continue, becauſe they are approved of by the greateſt part of Chriſtians: alſo the Revelations of St. <hi>Bridgit,</hi> St. <hi>Catherine,</hi> and St. <hi>Tereſa,</hi> are cleared from the like Aſperſion, becauſe they are countenanced by the <hi>Major</hi> part of Chriſtendome, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church: which, according to Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s conceſſion is a True Church. And ſure the approbation of a True Church, and ſo much extended, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is, is ſufficient to excuſe particular waies of Devotions, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Revelations from the imputation of Fanaticiſme; which neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a Reſiſtance againſt all Lawful, and competent Authority.</p>
               <p>Neither did I ever affirm in my Book, as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> groſsly miſtakes me, That Divine Authority, manifeſted by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, is not ſufficient, to clear particular manners, of preaching or Praying, from Fanaticiſme; as it happened to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Apoſtles, as I ſhewed above. Yea my Third Propoſition, <hi>pag.</hi> 9. was,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:102636:148"/>That <hi>the Aathority competent</hi> (and by a competent Authority I underſtand a Lawful Authority) <hi>to clear particular waies, and practiſes, from Fanaticiſme, is not neceſsarily Divine;</hi> as I prove there, with ſeveral inſtances. And certainly, Thoſe words clearly ſignifie, that I thought, the forementioned Authority might be Divine, But ſuch are the Arts Dr. <hi>St.</hi> uſes, in anſwering his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. He miſtakes ſome places; he takes no notice of others; and he blunders o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver others: and it is a great wonder, how frequently he makes uſe of theſe Artifices, in the Examination of my Book, though ſo ſhort.</p>
               <p>I ſhall cloſe up the whole Diſcourſe, with an addreſs to Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s Friends, (perhaps I ſhall have better luck with them, than I have had with the Dr. him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in the favours I requeſted at his hands) entreating them,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That as they tender the Honor of our Nation, (wherein Dr. <hi>St.</hi> bears ſo great a ſway) and the Credit of that famous Univerſity, whereof he is a Member, they would find out one way or other, to purge his brains from this
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:102636:149"/>peſtilent Humour of Self-contradiction; which infects all his Works, in ſuch a manner, that they ſeem to be nothing elſe, but ſo many Bundles of notorious Contradictions. This procedure of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is a ſhrewd conjecture, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port which goes about, is true, <hi>viz.</hi> That Dr. <hi>St.</hi> had only the penning of thoſe Books, which he has ſet forth; and that the Matter was ſuppeditated unto him from ſeveral Authors; who were wiſer than to publiſh ſuch things themſelves; and the good Dr. without ever conſidering the coherency of one thing with another, huddles all together, dreſſes it with Drollery, Flurts, and Gawdy Expreſſions, and then preſents it to publick View. For it ſeems impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that one Author, if he has an eye to what he writes, ſhould commit ſuch palpable Contradictions: whereas 'tis no wonder, that different Authors ſhould Contradict one another.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That ſince the Dr. as it ſeems miſpent the time that he ſhould have employed in learning Logick, in the peruſal of Play-books, and Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; they would procure ſome Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity-man
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:102636:149"/>to teach him the Rules of Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Diſcourſes. For it is a great affront for a Dr. of Divinity, to be ſo deficient, as we have proved him to be, even in the very Rudiments of Rationality: and if the Dr. ſaies, that <hi>it is too late for him to learn ſuch things,</hi> then they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to leave off Writing. Yea, who forced him to begin, when he knew himſelf unacquainted with ſo neceſſary a Faculty, for ſuch as write Polemical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes? Has not the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> other men, who underſtand the Rules of Logick, able to write in Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Proteſtancy?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That they would obtain of the Dr. if he be yet reſolved to write more Books of Controverſies, to lay aſide Railery, unleſs he pretends to be, not the Champion, but the Buffoon, of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church. Let him try whether he be not able to write ſomething, which though deveſted of all thoſe <hi>little Arts,</hi> he has hitherto made uſe of to ſet of his Works, may deſerve, not to lie upon the Stalls to be beſpatter'd with the dirt of Coach-wheels, and to be ſold off at laſt for waſt-paper.</p>
